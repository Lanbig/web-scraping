5.0,"""Great Washer!!!""",I have had my washer for 2 months and works great! I like how quiet the washer is and how quickly the machine cleans clothes and towels.
5.0,"""Love This Washing Machine!""","I was dreading having to go to the new HE washers (I had heard nothing but bad things about them from all of my friends/family that had bought one). However, I knew that I was very pleased with my other Samsung purchases (TV, Refrigerator and Dishwasher) so I was pretty positive I would be getting a Samsung Washing Machine. I did look at several brands, but Samsung has won me over and I was not disappointed. The machine is easy to use and my clothes come out so clean, I am once again so pleased that I went with the Samsung Brand!!!!!"
5.0,"""Solved 2 problems in 1 machine! AWESOME!""","I just bought this on 12/30/16, I did my research regarding the recall, but it was made clear that models presently sold in stores were not a part of it. The issue had been fixed on all models currently in stores and sold online through retail websites. I was hesitant at first to get an all electrical panel, as my husband thinks that it means more costly repairs if something goes wrong. However, since this was what I wanted for Christmas, he said the decision was up to me (AND told me to get a matching dryer, whatever I decided on!) :)What sold me on this one was the built in sink feature. (It also saved my hubby from having to install one in my laundry room.) After having to carry water for every load + rinse cycle, for the past 9 months, I wanted a sink for sure. BEST FEATURE EVER!! So far, I haven't used the sink to wash/pre-treat clothes, but use it for every load to do a quick rinse out of the fabric softener cup I use, before putting it back with the bottle. It works fabulous! Initially, when pressed, (you have to push the power button first) water goes into the drum for a second or two before switching to the sink. I can then use it, turn it off and back on again without issue and back off again. I cannot tell you how much I love this feature!Size- this washer and matching dryer are SO much larger than my previous ones! This was not a problem for me based on where they are in my laundry room, but I'd definitely recommend measuring your space and double checking the measurements of this unit. It is much taller than my previous ones, so I can no longer have the lid up and open the overhead cabinet door directly above it. This was not an issue with my old set. In fact, we had to pull this out an inch or two so the lid would stay up without me holding it, due to the weight of it with the sink attached, for loading. Again, not a deal-breaker by any means, but nothing we had thought of prior. Another feature I love is the gradual close of both the sink and lid. NO MORE SLAMMING! YAY! The tub itself is huge. AND I mean HUGE. So big in fact that I had no issue fitting my queen down comforter in it without looking cramped. I have NEVER been able to do that before! I used the bedding setting (which, be forewarned- takes about an hour and a half to complete the wash cycle on this setting). I left it alone, let it do it's business and went to switch it to the dryer after it completed and played a lovely tune. (Sounds can be turned off if desired, on both units.) I was amazed that it was spun very well and was thoroughly wet without looking damaged at all. (I'm even more impressed with how well the matching steam dryer dried it and made it look better than new! Also on the bedding setting.)Having said it is huge, I am 5'2"" and although I do have to lean over and go on my tippy toes at times to retrieve socks from the bottom of the tub, I can definitely reach everything without issue. I do however, now need a stool to reach the overhead cabinets because these come out much further than my other ones...that and I can't hop up to sit or kneel on top of these to reach now, either, lol. I think I'll like the fact that there's no controls on a back panel, as it keeps me from piling things on top of them. Plus, I really like that the lid is tinted glass so I can see inside without opening the lid. (Granted, having the sink feature does block your line of sight into the tub, though it is transparent.)I will not lie- these were delivered on a Saturday and it took 4 days for me to tackle the intimidation I felt with them, haha. I've never read a manual before for my appliances, but this one I didn't want to screw up! I discovered that there are certain cycles that are preset, so you cannot change some settings with them selected. However, you can change to another cycle setting and make your selections or trust the setting they've picked. I have had no issue with any of the preset cycles and have been washing all the bedding in my house that hasn't been washed in years since it wouldn't fit in my old washers. I've used the waterproof setting to wash 2 of my husband's insulated thermal jackets and they turned out fabulous! I got these on a fantastic sale from Lowe's and the delivery guys were extremely professional and knew what they were doing. This was important since my husband is very handy and knows what he's doing & how things work. I was not home for delivery so they dealt with him and he said it went great with no issues. They did say that this set should've cost me much more than it did and were impressed with what we paid. They did recommend buying the warranty though, but that's obvious given the recall they previously had and the price we paid.I hope this lasts for years and I remain as excited about their performance as time goes on. I cannot say enough good things about this washer! I love it!! So happy with my Christmas present! (Yes, I'd rather have this than jewelry!) :)"
5.0,"""Awesome Washer!""",Just got my new washer yesterday and it is absolutely fantastic! My last washer was a front loader and only had it for three years because the mold and mildew build up was horrendous. This active wash washer is so quiet I cannot even believe it. My laundry room is on the top floor and my last washer shook all of the glasses in our kitchen cabinet during the spin cycle. This washer I cannot even hear. I love the sink as I am potty training my toddler. I cannot say enough about how wonderful this washer is. My clothes now smell great and are clean!  This washer is a must have!!!
5.0,"""Great Deal""","Bought this washer off the damaged isle. Small dent in front. Washer is super Quiet and quick. If you are 5'6"" or less you might need a stool as the tub is deeeep. Very satisfied."
5.0,"""Samsung 4.5 cu ft top-load washer""",We have had many washers over the years. We have a front load Samsung washer in our other home and I must say we like this one better. It is large enough for us and cut down on our washing to a couple times a week instead of three to four times. My wife washed our king size bed spread with no problem.So far so good.
1.0,"""VRT Technology""","The washer cannot make it through a spin cycle. After ensuring the feet are level, the load is balanced (multiple tries), the washer enters the spin cycle and gets caught in a spin-error code Ub, rinse cycle. This washer is supposedly top of the line, but can't get through a spin cycle with even 3 items balanced perfectly in the wash. handful of items, 1/4 load, 3/4 load, doesn't matter. The only time we've had it successfully get through a spin cycle is when nothing is in it. we're returning it.the matching dryer is 5 stars however."
1.0,"""New today with error stop codes""","I just purchased this unit today, installed it, leveled it, and attempted to run the calibration mode. It reads error dC, which means the lid is not properly secured in place. The lid sits perfectly and lid is down and resting on the unit without any obstructions. The washer just fails to run because of this lid lock code. I'm hauling it back this evening for a refund. I'm not sure what I'll try next however I gave Samsung a shot because of these reviews. I'm done with Samsung."
1.0,"""Does not clean clothes…""",After purchasing this machine and installing it then running the calibration and running a test load we found that it does not even cover the clothes with water the clothes do not even become wet all over the clothes still come out after a full cycle partially dry  with soap still on portions of them that did not get wet! Contacted Samsung with no response. will be taking this machine back tomorrow! It takes no less than one hour to clean any clothing  and still does not get them clean. Ran all items on betting setting to try and boost the water level and still it does not cover all of the clothing even after running bedding in the machine it does not cover that with water and we've had to run it through two and three times......  Very disappointed with the amount of money paid and the quality of machine. It is not cycle the clothes through the water as it would if it had an agitator in the middle. The water level would not be as big a deal if it would cycle the closing from the top to the bottom and then back to the top again as the old ones dead ...
1.0,"""Constant errors""","Washer was delivered at 2:30 and when the delivery man installed it, he ran a quick rinse cycle to check for leaks. No leaks but immediate UR code (unbalanced rinse). I was a little concerned but thought maybe it's because the tub had no clothes in it. Ran my first full load and again, UR error came up. I was able to get the tub drained and clothes out. Ran a load of towels and constant UR codes and unbalanced codes. After filling up and emptying over and over and over, I finally turned the washer off to try to save water, wrung out the towels and put them in a 2 cycle dryer to get the sopping wet towels dry. Called Lowe's and they are picking up the machine tomorrow. Good riddance!"
2.0,"""Would not recommend""","I've had this washer for 7 months now and will not be recommending it to anyone. It has stained clothes yellow and grey more often than not and it has nothing to do with too much detergent or overloading the washer. The grey seems to come from stuff getting stuck in the tiny holes along the barrel. For some reason whatever these yellow and grey stains come from, they are permanent stains and have ruined many new clothing items I've boughten and a $50 Boppy pillow. Not happy. The washer also does not get stains out of clothing very well, even if I've thrown them in right after they get stained."
1.0,"""Won't last.  You'll get 5yrs tops.""","Purchased a Samsung WA5471ABW top load high efficiency washer in 08/2011.  Purchased 5yr extended warranty as well.  Here it is 10/28/16 and the washer is broken.  Not only that it is subject to a pending recall for exploding on the Spin cycle with a heavy load.  I fortunately 'or so I thought' purchased an extension on my 5yr warranty for $122.95 in July '16.  However, Lowes uses subpar repairmen to work on your product.  The first one had an 'F' rating on the BBB website so I rescheduled with a second one and now this one isn't showing up.  So forget the extended warranty.  It's worthless.  Samsung doesn't last.  Now keep in mind.  You're washer will wash like a champ for 5yrs.  Then it's game over.  If you only expect 5yrs then buy a Samsung.  If you're hoping for better look at another brand.  Just make sure you wash your bedding on the Gentle Cycle only."
5.0,"""Wonderful Washer""","Wife said it was ugly in the store, but I told her to trust me. Now she can't stop telling me how much she loves the washer and dryer and that they are actually ""cute"" now that they're in the house. We bought the pair at a great price at Lowes. This pair is very intuitive and has a ton of convenience and safety features. It is practically idiot proof. Very quiet, fast, and the clothes come out clean. highly recommend. Do yourself a favor and compare the workmanship between this washer and the other brands. Be sure to look under the top where the tub sits on the base. You will see that this washer is very well made compared to others."
1.0,"""Do NOT buy this product""","Purchased this machine along with the matching dryer in July of 2016 just before Samsung RECALLED the washers for EXPLODING. Which I am still dealing with Samsung over the Recall. I paid full price for the washer and they do not want to give a full refund only a partial refund. It gets prorated not to when you purchased it but to when the machine was manufactured. That is only the first problem. So, here it is March 2017 and NOW the washer has STOPPED WORKING ALL TOGETHER! The tub will NOT spin when washing clothes. It is still under the 1yr manufacturer warranty but after only 8 months of use this machine should not be broken. The last washer i had lasted for 14yrs without any problems. The only reason i replaced it was because the matching dryer stopped working. Keep in mind this machine has been recalled. Samsung's fix to the problem was to install metal bars inside the cabinet of the machine to reinforce the sides. As a consumer I do not see how that will stop the machine from exploding. Purchase at your own Risk. Very DISAPPOINTED SAMSUNG!"
1.0,"""Do Not Buy at any price!!!""","My machine is 2 years old. It has never cleaned clothes well. Over 1 year ago, I contacted them for a recall because the tops are coming off. Samsung sent a new control label & instructed not to run hi-speed spin on some cycles with no compensation. Now, unit will not spin out on any setting at any speed. Called Samsung who will replace at 200+ less what paid for since it's 2+ yrs old...when they should have replaced over a year ago. Now let's talk pathetic Samsung customer service. & days later and still no repair service scheduled. Samsung cancelled the first service request. Then they gave a repair ticket that belonged to another customer. And now I've spent 5+ hours on the phone with Samsung and my machine is still not repaired after 7 days...nor has Samsung even scheduled.Really can not say strongly enough, the machine does not clean and Samsung service is a bad joke."
2.0,"""Horrible""",We purchased this set in May of 2015. The washer has been making a horrible grinding noise for the last few months. When it spins it sounds like an airplane taking off. Had extra clips added because of a recall. Here it is August of 2017 and the whole thing needs replaced! Lowes bought out our warranty so they will send us the money we paid for it to go get a new one. I wont have a matching set anymore. The dryer also quit yesterday for the second time in 2 weeks. Just had a new thermostat put in it on July 15! Ridiculous. Will never buy another Samsung appliance.
1.0,"""Bad Purchase""","Machine goes off balance, sometimes clothes come out dirtier than they went in and I need to wash them again, has ripped sheets and clothing,etc.  Samsung customer support has not been helpful, you just get the run around.  When folks attempted to get there machines fixed, cable guys (yes, not Samsung repair men)are sent to fix them and the machines are often left in a worst way.  DO NOT BUY Samsung if you want quality or service."
1.0,"""Rusted out Samsung Washer after only 3 1/2 years!""","Purchased a similar model 3 1/2 years ago.  Totally rusted out around the bleach dispenser!Extended warranty does not cover it and Samsung says its ""cosmetic"".  Off to buy a Maytag.  Avoid Samsung at all costs!"
5.0,"""Love this washer and dryer""",No problems yet!!! I LOVE SAMSUNG PRODUCTS!!! THANKS!!
5.0,"""Great Washer!!!!""","Even though I have just received my new washer, I absolutely love it. It is so quiet and my towels seem so much cleaner than ever before. It is very user friendly, and I can't wait to get the matching dryer!"
5.0,"""Samsung top loading washer""",Great addition to the household. Quiet and pleased with the performance. Easy to use!
5.0,"""This is a wonderful washer""","Everything is great with the washer, it does what it is supposed to do. I like the scrubbing bowl other than it is a little in the way when getting items out of the bottom of the tub.I didn't set the Value at excellent only because everything in this world is OVER priced. ;-)"
5.0,"""Product is easy to use""",This Samsung washer has great features and easy to use controls. It is quiet and efficient with water use. Clothes washed so far have come out clean and spun very dry so dryer use is reduced. I would recommend this product to a friend.
5.0,"""Love My Washer""","Love this machine cleans sooo good, quite and a great deal."
4.0,"""Love this washer!""","This washer is nice and big. I love that it can wash comforters and blankets as well. Features are great, kind of confusing at first, but you get used to it quick. The prewash sink is what got my attention at first. It works pretty good, i just sometimes feel like its a big flimsy but I haven't had a problem yet."
5.0,"""Wash basket""",This machine is incredible. The clothes washed feel very clean. The many options for washing is perfect. Have used the hand wash basket a couple times and it's the element missing with all the other washers. So easy to pre wash this stubborn stains for a clean outcome!
5.0,"""This is a great product -Good Value""",Samsung washer is a really great buy for the money great features for an affordable price.
4.0,"""Love it""",Great features convenient 1push buttons to wash awesomeness.
5.0,"""Very impressed""","We have only had this washing machine a few weeks but so far I am in love. This machine is quiet while running I can barely hear it, but my clothes are coming out clean. I haven't had any issues with not enough water or left over soap residue like I have had with other machines in the past. Would recommend this to anyone, plus it has the added bonus of the active wash function allowing me to pretreat with out the mess of doing it in another room and carrying wet clothes to the washer."
5.0,"""Nice!""","Just got the Washer installed yesterday and it works GREAT!! So many buttons and choices we thought it would be overwhelming, but it wasn't. Quite and you hardly know it's working. Clothes came out clean and almost so dry they were ready to wear :). The only thing that I can say isn't a great feature is the wash tub being tinted so dark. My son wanted to watch the clothes being cleaned but the tub was too dark for him to see. So, that is his only complaint. I have no complaints."
5.0,"""Great features""",I love this washer it has so many features i pull things out of my closet just to try the different choices i have. Great product
4.0,"""Quick and fast delivery.""",I ordered this washing machine as it was the only one that really garnered favorable reviews. The machine is so quiet compared to my old ones and there are so many options for every type of wash you need.
5.0,"""Great Value Washer""",This washer has everything I was looking for and was a great choice for those deciding between the 7400 and 7700. This has everything and more than the 7700 and is slighter cheaper. The integrated controls are great and intuitive. I would definitely recommend!
5.0,"""I love this washing machine""",I love my new washing machine. I had it for about a month now. It makes very little noise and uses less water than my old one. My only wish is that it needs the option to make the end of cycle chime louder.
4.0,"""Big Drum!""",Love how big the drum is without the middle agitator. Love that I can reach in and not scrape my hands on one. Either this is deeper then my old machine or I have shrunk. My husband is a little taller than me and he can reach in to get all the laundry without stepping on his tippy toes. 3 loads down and I am happy so far!
5.0,"""Easy to use!""","Love the large display, easy to use, great value!!"

4.0,"""Lots of features""",Just got this washer - love the sink - large washer basket - think I will like the waterproof washing mode
5.0,"""Eco Conscious""",I really like the eco conscious features. Conserving energy and water helps reduce pressure on local infrastructure. That just makes dollars because it makes sense.
5.0,"""My newest appliance(s)""","As I've only just received my products today, I'm not sure how accurate this review will be. But, I can always update it later if necessary.  I bought this washer and matching dryer unexpectedly. About a year and a half ago, my washer needed to be replaced, but we couldn't afford to replace the dryer and it was still working fine, so we waited. Now that time had come to get the dryer, the model was no longer being made.  My wonderful husband realized that I would go bananas living with a mis-matched set and offered to buy me a new washer and dryer combo and this was the set we chose. From my experience using it one time, it seems very easy to use and has awesome features that my last washer did not. I like how quiet it is and when it is done it plays a soft jingle! I'm looking forward to doing laundry this weekend to put it to the test."
5.0,"""Excellent machine""","I only had one thing I don't like about the washer. All other features perform well above my expectations, and I especially like the waterproof wash function. I use the washboard often, and do not like that I have to press the power button on the top controls first to use the add water button. I usually start with the lid up and the washboard ready to clean heavily soiled clothes. I always forget that I have to close the top lid and hit the power button to use the add water function. I understand that this is probably a safety feature to keep children from flooding the laundry room if they were to push the add water button, and forget to turn it off. With that being the only item I dislike on this washer, it is one of the best clothes washers I have ever purchased."
1.0,"""Broke down within 3 months of purchased. Found out it is on the recall list.""",Hope to get another Samsung brand clothes washer that will last for years.
5.0,"""appliances""",I was a little hesitant when I needed a new washer.I had my previous washer top-load with the agitator for 25 years..I'am so happy with the results this washer performs quietly and quickly.Highly recommend.
5.0,"""Overall I love it""",I had an old Samsung that I wish they still had features on the newer models (i.e. soak feature - for as long as you want) - now they limit to 30 minutes - and more personal cycles to save. Overall I love it - nice and roomy and haven't had any issues.

5.0,"""This washer has great options""",I am extremely happy with how clean the laundry comes out. The instruction book is easy to read. The washer is easy to use. I am extremely happy it's made of 100% recyclable material which makes this Samsung machine a win/win!
5.0,"""Great washer so far""","I purchased this particular washer mainly for the added basin since I do not have a utility sink in the laundry room. Its a nice bonus on this great washer. So far the washer has been very quite while running. The cloths have been coming out clean. The amount of cloths that can fit it the washer is great, its huge! This is my second agitator-less machine. Its hard to even find a washer with an agitator nowadays. As with any machine like this, make sure you pack the cloths in like a doughnut I usually try to see the bottom in the middle when all the cloths are in. This helps ensure everything is going to get fully clean and its not overloaded. There are also a lot of washing options on the control panel which is nice. I would recommend this washer if you are out looking for a new one."
5.0,"""Simply amazing.""","My wife and I have been saving up for a while to get a new washer and dryer. We looked at several models from various companies and at different stores. My wife, instantly fell in love with the Samsung activewash. We have three small children ( ages 4, 2, and 1) and the ability to prewash within the washer was a most thing for our family. My wife actually seems excited to do laundry, but not the folding. Thank you so much for such an outstanding product."
4.0,"""Quick and easy!""","Quick, easy to use, spin is just perfect, does not ruin your clothes and plays a nice little tune at the end of each cycle. Best of all your clothes are actually clean when you pull them out!"

5.0,"""Top Notch Best Washer Ever. Period""","This washer rocks. It is almost like it has Artificial Intelligence by know what the load basically consists of and to use that information that it gathers so quickly to wash perfectly. Also the different options are endless and cover anything you would need to wash. Washed items come out cleaner than any other washer I have owned. I have always wanted a Samsung Washer and finally have one and know why Samsung still is a leader in technology, even for a washing machine."
4.0,"""Nice washer""",We purchase this washer and love it .It has everything you could need.
5.0,"""What a great washer""","I just received this washer today. I have already washed 3 loads of laundry and I have to say this is by far the best washer I have had. My previous washer was a front loader and I did not like it because you have to clean the rubber seal after every wash. Even though I did this, it still gave my clothes a strange smell. This top load washer is amazing and very user friendly. I hooked it up myself, collaborated it and washed 3 loads all before my husband got home, yay me. I love how it has a built in sink to soak stained items. I absolutely love this since we don't have a sink in the laundry room so it works out perfect for us. Another great feature this washer came with is an app that you can download to help with error codes on the washer. This beats having to look through the manual or calling someone. I would definitely recommend this washer to anyone. Great washer with lots of features for an affordable price."
5.0,"""Beautifully Quiet!""","We purchased the washer and the dryer two days ago and it was promptly delivered with no issues at all. It is so easy to operate and I love the rinse feature (we don't have a sink in our laundry area). We have a family of four and for the first time EVER, I was able to get everyones white clothes done in one load. How wonderful! It would take sooooo long to get clothes done, that we dreaded wash day. Not anymore. And it's so quiet. I was able to take a conference call with the french doors open to the unit and I forgot it was on! Don't get me wrong, I still don't like wash day, but this product makes it much more bearable."
4.0,"""I've just received delivery this week but so far I'm happy""",I had purchased a samsung washer 4 1/2 years ago and it totally rusted out. But because of recall on that model I decided to give Samsung another try. I was surprised and extremely pleased when my washer arrived. It's very modern looking and washes quietly. Looks like they addressed the rust problem as the metal areas are now changed.
5.0,"""WE LOVE SAMSUNG""",This is not your grandmas washer it is the best appliance i have bought everything in our home from phones to tvs are Samsung so it was a no brainier when it came time to by the washer thanks for making such great products Tyler and April
5.0,"""So many options!""","The washer was delivered to my house today, and I already love it. It takes longer than my 20 year old top load, since this is new technology to me, it will take some getting used to. I have already gotten two loads done and our clothes smell and look so clean! You can definitely tell the detergent is dispersed better with the water, and no more guessing on water level, as it weighs the load and dispenses the water accordingly. Also, it is so quiet! I can't tell if it's done without the little song playing. I love the waterproof option for our ski pants and winter clothes. I can't wait to try the pre wash basket. I have always been a stain blaster, and this option will make it so easy. It's taller than I remember from the store, so it can be hard to reach small items (socks) from the bottom of the basket (I'm 5'7""). Time will definitely tell with how long the panel lasts and how it stands up to larger loads. After only a few hours, I am hooked on this sleek beast."
5.0,"""Great Product!""",Best washing machine Ive ever owned. Very quiet and very dependable. Would definitely recommend to a friend!
5.0,"""WASHER""",LOVE THIS WASHER. LOVE THE SOUNDS IT MAKES. LOVE HOW CLEAN MY CLOTHES SMELL. AND LOVE HOW BIG IT IS.
5.0,"""Really like the washer""","I have my new washing machine for a few weeks now and really like it. It has a lot of features, which took a little while to get the hang of them. My wash is very clean, and it is very quite machine. I had a front load maytag before, I like the top loader again."
5.0,"""Quiet and fast""","Just purchased this washer, and love it. So quiet that we now leave our laundry door open when it is washing. The time saved by the quick wash feature frees up more time for other fun things, like play with the grandkids. couldn't be any happier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
5.0,"""Easy to use and so quiet""",We love the quietness of this machine. The design is great and it is working great! I have been researching it and it is the VRT technology that made me chose this machine.
5.0,"""This product is well worth the investment.""",This washer is wonderful. It is easy to operate and has all the features I want and more. It is quiet compared to my old washer.
5.0,"""Top Loaders all the way!""","Awesome purchase runs quick and quietly, had to get a new washer for my 7 person family and this has really saved us when our other washer broke on us. I will never go back to a front loader that only lasted 6 years. Customer support was excellent and helped me register my product when I was having issues doing it myself online. I feel like the clothes get the best possible wash they can in this machine."
5.0,"""Nice Machine""","So Far, so Good !!! Nice machine and can't wait to learn all of the bells and whistles."
4.0,"""Good value""","Bought this washer two weeks ago, so far very impressed. Wife loves the integrated prewash/soak tub in the lid. So far, very happy!"
5.0,"""Great Washer""",We love our new Washer! The built in sink is very convenient for quick pre-soak or rinsing out delicates. The large washer interior holds up great for washing bedding and saved me a trip to the dry cleaners for my quilts!Very pleased!
5.0,"""Simply amazing.""","My wife and I have been saving up for a while to get a new washer and dryer. We looked at several models from various companies and at different stores. My wife, instantly fell in love with the Samsung activewash. We have three small children ( ages 4, 2, and 1) and the ability to prewash within the washer was a most thing for our family. My wife actually seems excited to do laundry, but not the folding. Thank you so much for such an outstanding product."
1.0,"""HORRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY""","Worst junk we've ever wasted a whole lot of money on. Samsung should have stayed with electronics. Don't do it! Clothes come out dirtier than they go in. Covered in detergent scum and lint. Black pants are destroyed. Clothes that were folded, still come out folded! The full cycle takes 2 hrs and they still smell bad, and are not clean. So frustrating trying to figure out how to wash clothes. I even did a white towel load with bleach and they came out dingy. Forget about any stains you miss. It doesn't add enough water. It supposedly has a water temp sensor...pffft! At one point, I was adding pails of hot water into it. We've had this set for over a year now, and this is what I came up with: You have to put a small (but not too small) load, make sure not to have anything black on the bottom, set it to Short Cycle/Hot/Extra Rinse/ run upstairs to make sure the hot water is running through the pipes, and it does the load in 55 minutes.  You might as well bite the bullet and get an actual front loader, these are basically the same inside, but top load. At least gravity helps in the front loaders. I hope to get a stackable set with an agitator next time."
5.0,"""Easy and well made""",I really like the quality of this machine. Sturdy and well built. Also very flexible. Well done
5.0,"""quiet""",This machine is super quiet cant even hear it running Love the face it has no center agitator easy to load bulky items and towels as opposed to a front loader or standard machine. My only downfall for me I wish I were a little taller as machine is quite deep but not hard to adjust to reaching. Also had to adjust to panel lights blinking when operating as opposed to a solid light but thats very minor. Overall I am completely satisfied with this product.
4.0,"""Dynamic Duo""","Just purchased washer/dryer combo and thoroughly pleased. Great price, on time delivery and easy to install...Saved Bucks$$$ on the install. simple to read instructions. Now listening to it purrrr....as it washes the first couple of loads. Highly satisfied..."

5.0,"""Great washer""","Our family, loves this washer. Has great features, value and the design is great."
5.0,"""Quiet""","Excelent purchase, extremely quiet had to come and see a couple of times if it was still working!, very happy so far with it; the only thing that i would like to tweek is the sound of the alert when is finished washing to be a bit louder, other than that is a great purchase."
1.0,"""Nothing ""high efficiency"" about this washer""","I've had this washer for about 6 months. I never thought I'd be wanting my old washer back but this one takes just too much of my time and energy. Dark clothes come out with more lint than what they had when they went in, in addition to being terribly wrinkled. Every time I wash anything dark colored I have to use a lint roller both inside and out on each piece before I put it in the machine. I have tried everything, First I went back to the glowing reviews about this washer to see if anyone else had this problem. Then I searched ""complaints Samsung he washer"" Yes, a LOT of people did. Research shows that the newer washers have no lint filter and one of the reasons for all the lint was the small amount of water which fills the tub. This washer weighs the load to determine how much water to add. So I now add an extra weight until it starts to fill, then remove it which means I have to stand in front of the washer until it starts to fill, more time wasted. I also started using the Aqua Jet in the hopes that would make the rinse more effective. I now wash everything on Delicate to help with the wrinkles, some I just do not spin and hang out. I run the self clean cycle and run a lint free rag around the complete tub and rims to get the grit that is still there before I run a load of dark clothes. The clothes look a little better but they still come out with more lint than they went in with which sometimes requires an additional rinse plus more de-linting. VERY time consuming and probably using more water than I should. If I could return this washer I would definitely do so."
5.0,"""Great features""","Just purchased and so far I am very pleased with everything. Excellent fit and finish, very stable and sturdy. Going to take awhile to get used to all the functions."
4.0,"""Balance""","I like the features and how the washer cleans, but I cannot get it to balance out after numerous tries."

5.0,"""BEST WASHER I'VE EVER OWNED!!!""","I absolutely love my Samsung Top Load Activewash Washer! First off it is so simple and easy to use. The built in sink is an excellent feature for moms like me with messy kids! Another great feature is the super speed cycle that's only 36 minute cycle! I love the sleek modern design along with the fantastic performance! And best of all, it is super quiet!"
4.0,"""Just brought it home""","After wading through the thousands of reviews I was unimpressed with the products available. We stopped at our local home center and this unit was on display. My wife was adamant she wanted a top loading HE model. Our old unit had stopped working and clothes were piling up. The price was fair and all they had was the display. We took it and installed it in about 30 minutes. We've completed about four loads and it appears to be working just fine. It does what it is advertised to do, clean clothes."
5.0,"""new just delivered""",only ran one load as just received it had to wait 10 days
4.0,"""This washer does it all""","Only have this washer for 2 days but love it already. Love the built in wash basin......great for pre treating stains, or pre-rinsing kids swim suits. Didn't give 5 stars because I only have it 2 days. I am sure it will earn that 5th star in due time"
4.0,"""Washing Machine""",I moved from Australia to USA and my husband was in charge of purchasing the products needed for our new house. He did a great job and picked a very good machine for me. the machine is quite large and I need a step ladder sometimes to get the clothes out but that would be the only downfall. we have always had Fisher Paykel products and I had my last washing machine for at least 15 years. will see how long I can make this one last.
5.0,"""great features""",the first washer I received was defective but samsung replaced it right away. Was very surprised by the way they handled the problem. the replacement is perfect. very easy to set up. so far it washes everything perfect. time will tell but so far Iam happy I purchased this model.
5.0,"""Different but good""","Will start by saying this little machine is great...besides the recall that may be on it.. We haven't had issues with it and had it since September. Some things to know about it for the person who washes and is upgrading to a touch/no agitator model:1) the machine will sound very weird to you when you first use it. It is not broken. It will sound broken, though. When you are used to an old school machine that just starts the water and goes for it, it sounds like this one is the 'little engine that could' at first. The sound will be like it is straining to start, but it is actually just balancing the load before water starts or anything pops on. It's normal. Annnnnd, they should say that somewhere. :) 2) For the best results, line stuff around the outside, leaving the middle completely free. This is not a washer you just throw it in, hit start and go. Take the extra 15 seconds to do this, it makes everything simpler. 3) If I had to do it over, I would have skipped the little basket on top. Still haven't used it, and that's even after looking for something to TRY to use in it. Ugh, the marketing of it worked on us. 4) The little song it plays when your cycles are over make me smile. I tell you it's the simple things in life, lol... it is so much nicer than the mean air horn sound the old machine made to signal end of cycle. That being said, with the laundry door closed, don't always hear it. I also am waiting for the day you can pick your own song. Ha.  Overall, great machine. Would recommend. This is our first go with Samsung and because of the phone issues and now wash machine recall issues, not sure we will doing the fridge and rest of kitchen upgrades with them until we have this wash/dryer set a while."
1.0,"""A disappointment""","It worked well for two and a half months before malfunctioned, and I couldn't wash in cold water anymore. I've had to wait for repairs, and there's no guarantee that the replacement parts will correct the problem. A real inconvenience since I do laundry two or three days a week."
5.0,"""excellent product""",I would buy anything Samsung ...love love love it.. if I ever decide to buy any other products it will be a Samsung
5.0,"""great value and performance""","I have had a samsung washer in the past and loved it. When choosing a new washer I choose the brand again. I used to have a front load samsung and liked it but this top loader is wonderful and works well with our ""new to us"" home. I was impacted by the recall but have liked how samsung handled the recall and choose the same model again. It takes me forever to make a choice on things like appliances. When moving in this house it was made easier because I knew the brand that I wanted. I have a samsung refridgerator, washer and dryer and when the kitchen gets its makeover I see a samsung dishwasher in my future."
5.0,"""Nice and quiet""",This machine runs like it has it's own brain! I like it that I don't even have to think!!
5.0,"""Great Washer for the Price""","We have only had this washer for 2 weeks but i am loving it. It's quiet and the best washer i have ever owned. Only issue we had with it was when my son washed his pillows and we got the UB Error which is Unbalanced, we had to remove the pillows and the 2 blankets he had in the washer then place them back in minus the pillows and had to put the pillows back in by themselves. We havent had a UB or UR Error since."

5.0,"""State of the Art""","This is a phenomenal appliance! the built in active wash sink is great for soaking or washing out single pieces of laundry. The quiet wash cycle is impressive, no loud blundering noises or hard vibration, just a soft whirring sound at best. Gets the laundry super clean. Integrated control panel is the best. Bells and whistles make it easy to operate. Would definitely recommend"

Very easy controls and I like the song it plays when I turn it on. Can't wait to try out the sink feature, I already played with that and it's so cool. Will be very helpful come sports season w grass stains and ice cream stains!"
5.0,"""Great washer! Quick and efficient, can fit large loads.""","Have only had this washer a few days, but so far, so good! Love the sink idea... have already used it pre-cleaning my 15 month-old's clothes. I can already tell that will be a very useful feature for many years to come. Done about 6+ loads of laundry thus far and this washer really does well at spinning the water out of the clothes for the dryer. Overall very pleased thus far with my purchase."

4.0,"""Great Features""",This washer really works well and has great features to customize your wash. We bought it to fit in a tight area which it does. The cabinet overhead though does not allow us to have both the inside tray and the to door ajar simultaneously so it is cumbersome to load/unload. That is not an issue for the machine; just our house.

It can hold lots of laundry, is very quiet, and gets our clothes very clean. I love the song it plays when my clothes are ready for the dryer! So much more pleasant than the old school buzzer!

Love the bells when the cycle is finished, the style, design etc. I'm very happy with my purchase!"
4.0,"""Good for tall people""","I've only had this machine a few days, so these are my first impressions. It seems to do a good job washing and I especially like how good it wrings out the clothes, requiring less time in the dryer. I'm trying to get used to the long cycles, that can take over a hour to complete. The sink feature is a tremendous help when there's no utility sink in the laundry room. Be advised it is much taller than the average washer and it best suits a person of height with a long reach."
