5.0,"""Love! Love! Love!""","This is truly the best washer I've even owned.  Crazy but I'm so excited to do laundry!!!  I agree with all the complimentary technical info  other reviews stated. I have one minor issue but other consumers need to be aware of the depth of the drum.  I am 5'5"" and I still need to stand on tiptoes to reach items such as socks or small children's items.  One review mocked another person that had mentioned this issue,  but I do think it is relative to the prospective purchaser."
5.0,"""Best washer Yet!""",After much research we decided to purchase this washer. It washes clothes so clean and so much water removed takes no tune to dry.Very quite and easy to use.We replaced our 5 year old LG due to a rust problem LG says was cosmetic . Easy to use READ directionsGreat service from lowes and installers made sure it was level and ran checks b4 they left.  Cannot beat the price.This is one product we did invest in the 5 year warranty lowes offers at a reasonable price.
4.0,"""Jury is still out as we've only had it a few weeks""","It washes the clothes good and looks nice and the buttons are touch sensitive, not press sensitive so just touch them to activate them.  We are still learning the best settings for each type of clothes because it definitely is different from our old front loading washing machine.  The best thing about this machine is that it is quiet and can hold a lot of clothes.  No longer do I have to hear the loud noises from my old washer.  The biggest complaint I have so far is I can't seem to figure out which setting is best to prevent or decrease wrinkles for a normal load of laundry.  Many loads are coming out of the washing machine with a lot of wrinkles and my wife likes to hang dry many of our clothes and they have quite a few wrinkles in them and we both despise ironing.  We have put the clothes in the dryer for a few and they are a little better, but I wasn't expecting to run into this when we purchased this washer.  It is new and we are still learning it, so I don't want to sound like I'm negatively saying anything as it is probably just we haven't given sufficient time to figure everything out.  It works, there is not problems, and it washes clothes quietly.  That is sufficient for me for now.  Also if you are short you will need to buy a small step stool to reach into the bottom of the washer to get out the clothes.  My wife is 5' and she has to use a 5"" step stool to get everything out. I've also purchased the 5 year extended protection because my experience with any new appliance now a days is that they don't make them to last 20 years like they use to.  Usually if you get 5 to 10 years out of a new appliance you are doing good.  Hope this helps."
5.0,"""Very nice upgrade from a front loading HE machine""","We've had this machine for three weeks now and we've washed about 18 loads with it. It is like others have said, extremely quiet while operating. So far the clothes we've washed have come out very clean and it generally works fast to get the loads clean. The styling of it is modern. I've used the active wash sink a few times and I like the convenience it offers. As for the installation: We have a shelf above the machine on the wall. You should make sure that you have 61"" of space above the washer in order for the door to open and remain opened. It fit just in our space which was positive. Overall, I'm very happy with the style and the functionality of this machine. The capacity is huge. I've washed a sleeping bag in it already with no problems. It will hold all of our towels for the week. We've also been able to combine our children's clothes in with our parent loads so we are washing fewer loads each week. Highly recommend this item."
1.0,"""Do NOT Buy!""","We purchased this washer and dryer set May of 2016, due partly to the great reviews. The washer completely stopped working only 5 months later! It will not even turn on! Samsung customer service was absolutely awful to me! I went round and round with them for 6 days straight. After 2 weeks of not having a washer and having to wash my son's clothes by hand, I went in to Lowes and begged for help. They agreed to take them both back and get me into a different brand because I will no longer buy anything Samsung! Lowes was amazing! I will buy all of my appliances from Lowes but will NEVER buy Samsung again!"
2.0,"""Give it time""","I purchased the earlier model in December 2014. It's now September 2016 and the pulsator cap on the washer's tub came off. It's a cap in the very center of the bottom of the tub. In the attached photo, it's located in the very center of what looks like an airplane propeller.  When it broke, it exposed the clothes to a bare nut that holds the tub in place, or maybe the bottom of the tub in place (not a washer repair guy so forgive me). The washer came with a 3 year warranty on the tub. When I phoned Samsung I was told that the pulsator cap wasn't part of the tub warranty and was covered for only one year. I explained that the cap is in fact part of the tub because it's located IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TUB. They refused to replace the part under warranty. So, yes it's a great washer for the 21 months it held together but buyer beware. It's either a design flaw or just shoddy workmanship. Either way it's poor customer service."
2.0,"""Poor washer""",This washer has been a complete disappointment. It has ripped our clothes and twists them in knots that require ironing clothes I never had to iron before. On top of that it has broken two times in 6 months. Right now I'm sitting in my laundry room surrounded by piles of dirty laundry--trying to figure out how to pack for a trip because I know the repairman will never make it on time (from my previous experience with this broken washer). I'm wishing I'd never bought this washer. Buyer beware.
1.0,"""This Model is under recall! Do not purchase.""","I bought this washer 6 months ago, for  $899.00 with an extended warranty. Shortly thereafter it was recalled voluntarily by Samsung, because the top of the washer can separate from the machine during the spin cycle and cause damage and injury. Samsung is only willing to give me $749.00 towards a replacement Samsung washer, or I can choose to have a DISH repairman come out and reinforce the top. Reports from people that have had the repairs done are generally negative. Lowe's has not offered any assistance at all with this problem. It is a discouraging situation. Even though this appears to be a fabulous machine at a great price, don't be tempted. It won't be worth the aggravation!  https://pages.samsung.com/us/tlw/"
1.0,"""wast of money do not buy""",got a Samsung in may of 2015. it stopped working by 9/2016. wont start at all. Now i have a $700 repair bill. i would never buy a Samsung again. would give it
4.0,"""Loud pump motor or I would rate it five stars!""",There is a a lot to like about this latest design on the Active Wash 5-cu ft Top load series washer.  The other reviews cover everything you want to know about it really.  The surprizing thing I found when we got ours delivered is how noisy it is at times because of how loud the pump motor in the spin cycle.  People say the washer is quiet and it is on all the cycle oporations except when the water is being drained in the spin cycle. So if that issue ever gets addressed then I think the machine would deserve a five star rating.
1.0,"""Don't buy a Samsung Washer.  5yr lifespan.""","Purchased a Samsung WA5471ABW top load high efficiency washer in 08/2011.  Purchased 5yr extended warranty as well.  Here it is 10/28/16 and the washer is broken.  Not only that it is subject to a pending recall for exploding on the Spin cycle with a heavy load.  I fortunately 'or so I thought' purchased an extension on my 5yr warranty for $122.95 in July '16.  However, Lowes uses subpar repairmen to work on your product.  The first one had an 'F' rating on the BBB website so I rescheduled with a second one and now this one isn't showing up.  So forget the extended warranty.  It's worthless.  Samsung doesn't last.  Now keep in mind.  You're washer will wash like a champ for 5yrs.  Then it's game over.  If you only expect 5yrs then buy a Samsung.  If you're hoping for better look at another brand.  Just make sure you wash your bedding on the Gentle Cycle only."

2.0,"""NOT FOR BEDDING""",EVERYTIME I WASH BEDDING THE SHEETS GET TANGLED UP AND THE SPIN CYCLE DOESNT WORK VERY GOOD MY BEDDING BE SOAKED
5.0,"""5-cu ft !!!""","I see few fox gave only  4 stars for something I personally consider to be a big advantage : “5.0-cu ft capacity” . Come on guys! People want to know about the washer, not about your issues with your height :-)"
1.0,"""Don't ever buy a Samsung washer or dryer""","Nightmare, I purchased this washer and dryer set July 2016, return one set had the same problem out of the second washer now it is on recall can't get any satisfaction from Samsung I was told they will replace the washer not the dryer, my problem is now you want me to have a set that's not matching I refuse ever to buy a Samsung Appliance again, I've been talking with them sense October 2016 it's now February 2017 still nothing has been done, now I feel I'm being forced to purchase this machine again just to have a matching set."
2.0,"""Sink is nice, but that's the only benefit""","The washer does not clean that well. Also, it does have many options, however, you are often unable to mix and match different settings (for example, you can't soak if you use the delicate cycle). I have had it for a year and a half and am replacing it with a different brand."
5.0,"""Awesome Washer""",I absolutely love this washer machine. My only complaint is that I almost have to lay down on it to get the items out of the bottom of the machine due to the largeness of it. I love that I don't have to wash as often--it saves a lot of time!
5.0,"""Great Product""","light weight, lots of options, very steady, less noise or vibrations,"
5.0,"""this product has great fetures, quiet operation""","Runs quiet and with less vibration, nice clean apearance"
5.0,"""Love my new washer!""","Super easy to use and so quiet I keep going to the laundry room to make sure it is still on. I love the Samsung brand. I have purchased televisions, tablets, cell phones and now a washer. Thank you Samsung!"
5.0,"""STUNNING!""","Not only is this a BEAUTIFUL looking machine, it works BEAUTIFULLY! I AM IMPRESSED."
4.0,"""Good product""","This washing machine is nice. It works great and I haven't had any issues with it yet except for the recall, which has been a little frustrating to say the least. I think once someone finally comes out to fix the recall and I an able to use the washing machine to its fullest capabilities it will be a very pleasing product."
5.0,"""This product is great""",This is the best washer. It is quiet and does the job!
5.0,"""Great so far""",After a week of ownership no problems have come up. Plenty of features and easy to set up.
4.0,"""Nice Qualities of Samsung Top Load Washer""","The Samsung top load washer has many good features including the following: an attractive design and display panel; nice color; quietness during operation; a wide range of options for different types of loads; a large tub that accommodates various load sizes; separate receptacles to add the detergent, liquid bleach, and fabric softener."
5.0,"""Love it""",I absolutely love this washer. I received this washer along with the dryer to match as a gift from my mother
4.0,"""Samsung Washer is Great!""","I love my new samsung 8600. It holds 3X's the amount of laundry compared to my old washer. It's innovative technology with its chic design is everything and more! I cant say enough about this washer. I highly recommend it for a buyer thats looking for the next ""big"" thing in washers. The samsung 8600 would be the way to go!"
5.0,"""Last washer I'll ever need""","I was a bit skeptical when purchasing a new top loading he washing machine, but Samsung made the switch easy. The washing machine performs excellent and is simple to use. The touch screen display makes its use even simpler. I love this washing machine and for the price I paid was well worth it."
5.0,"""Smart and Easy to Use""",I just got it today. I used Washer and was amazed at amount of clothing it can handle. I also like the Wash settings that make choosing cycle easy. I love that it senses load size to automatically fill water to correct level. Working great and happy I chose this for my new Washer.
5.0,"""Fabulous""",First time buyer and has always loved Samsung products.
5.0,"""Best Washer I've Owned""",I just purchased this washer and am very happy with it so far. The first day I ran several loads using the Super Speed function and it works as advertised. I'm looking forward to using the Active Wash function.
4.0,"""Form and Function""","This machine is sleek, modern and has everything including the bathroom sink. The redesigned pretreat basin is handy for those of us who do not have a laundry room with a sink. It clips out of the way when not in use and the water enters from the left rather than the rear. The tub itself is stainless steel and I like the self clean function especially after finishing a grimy load. The electronic board is intuitive, easy to use and the machne runs so quietly I had to double check to make sure it was running. There is something of a learning curve even after reading the manual. The manual and Samsung's online helpline are indispensable. It seems some loads could use more water. HE detergent is a must. My first two loads of towels and underwear came up a little stiff compared to my previous washer. But I am experimenting with different settings and will then program the ""my cycle"" function. An unexpected treat is the little chime it rings instead of a buzzer. There is also a phone app I downloaded that helps read error codes on the machine. I hope I won't be needing that. I would have given this washer five stars except that the bottom of the drum is difficult to reach and this model does not have a steam function or a setting for wool. The real test of this machine will be the test of time. My last one lasted 27 years. I start counting today. If I could I would come back in 6 months with an update."
5.0,"""Looks Great, Tons of Features, Great Price!""",So far this washer has been great. We love the black stainless color of the washer as well. There are numerous wash setting to chose from to always make sure you get the right setting for the right load. Operation is super quiet as well. You don't even realize it is on. One this I would caution people on is that the to scratches very easily as well as the control panel. Make sure you wipe things down with a lint free cloth and you shouldn't have too many issues.
5.0,"""Great product""","Very easy, smart y good looking product. We really love it."
5.0,"""One Month with normal use""","This washer performs as advertised. Fast and efficient. Quiet and clothes are clean.Vast improvement over 10 year old front load machine.Touch controls work well. Very deep drum, can offer difficulty to reach articles in bottom for some people. Great product. Hope it holds up and stands test of time."
5.0,"""Set & Forget!""","My husband and I love our new Samsung Washer. The black stainless finish is sleek and beautiful. The size of the drum is HUGE and I even need to get a small step stool just so I can reach the stuff in the bottom {I'm 5'4""}. I love all of the wash settings and the fact that I can throw my clothes in there and it auto-senses the load size means that I am not wasting a bunch of water. It's nice and quiet too! I especially love the little music tones Samsung designed letting you know the cycle is finished. This washer goes fabulously with their dryer and makes our lives much easier!!"
5.0,"""Need to measure""","Products were really to big for a small laundry area. They do not sit back far enough if you have above cabinets over them (lid on washer will not stay up due to bumping cabinet). If dryer vent is in floor, it will not sit far back making it difficult to open door in small spaces. Otherwise, a great product and overall happy with the general use of it."
5.0,"""SAMSUNG BACK AT IT AGAIN!""","This washer is amazing, from features to style. I can not look at another wash as I look at this one. Really amazing."
3.0,"""THIS PRODUCT IS NOISY""",THIS WASHER IS VERY NOISY. IT STOPS DURING CYCLES. THE BUTTONS ARE TOO HARD TO PUSH EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS HOLD FOR 3 SECONDS YOU END UP HOLDING IT FOR 10 SECONDS. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. IT HAS GIVEN ME MORE THAN JUST A HEADACHE. AND YOU CANT SET ANYTHING ONTOP OF IT.
5.0,"""great to use""","I love my new washer. Love the steam cycle, it is going to be so very helpful with not having to iron a lot of things I have always ironed. Love being able to wash my king size comfort, blankets, etc, at home and not have to go to a laundry mat to do this. If you are a short person like I am you will need a little step stool to use to get things in and out of the bottom of the washer, arms are not long enough."
5.0,"""Great Product""","light weight, lots of options, very steady, less noise or vibrations,"
3.0,"""regret buying this machine too many issues""",too many issue to write about I will be getting a new machine
5.0,"""This washer has everything""","I've only done about 6 loads,but it does everything it says. It's easy to use, but I do read the manual. I love it so far & it's fun to work with. I've been doing large loads because that's why I got this washer & it works great. I'm also doing delicate & I love the sink. I wasn't interested at first,I thought it would be in the way, but then I realized I have a lot of hand wash items I can now do in the washer. It's also a very quiet washer. I got a lot more in a washer than I ever expected for the price I paid."
5.0,"""Great product""","Washer is easy to use, self explanatory when needing to find the setting for the load you're washing. Size of the drum is very nice."
5.0,"""Best Washer to date""","After reading several reviews on this washer. I decided that I still wanted it. I am so Very happy that I made the purchase!!!! It is an awesome washer!!! I really hated my front loader and this one is AWESOME!!!!! I can fit my KING size comforter in it and not take it to the laundry mat!!! LOVE, LOVE it!!!"
5.0,"""As Advertised""",Product has many great features and works wonderfully.
5.0,"""Love my new washer""",I honestly can say I love my new washer I went back to a top loader from previously and owning front loaders. The amount of space is unbelievable inside this amazing washer.
5.0,"""Best Washer I've Ever Used""","I bought this washer to replace an old one that had run its course. The main things I was looking for was a washer that was big enough to handle heavy loads and one with a digital setup. This unit has both and then some. It is extremely easy to use. I would have given it 5 stars all around except that the drain hose that comes attached to the unit was too short to reach my drain pipe and there was no way to remove it to hook up a longer hose that I already had. I had to purchase another hose and then attach it to the Samsung hose to make it long enough to reach the drain pipe. The pros definitely outweigh the cons though. If you're thinking of getting this unit just keep in mind where your drain pipe is; you may need to extend it. But that aside, I'm very happy with the washer and would recommend it to anyone!"
5.0,"""quiet and easy to use""","Only have had it 2 weeks, but love how quiet it is and easy to use. had a front loader before but like this top loader so much better."
5.0,"""Beautiful design""",Been installed for only two daysQuiet operation Have done 4 loads so farClothes come out clean and dry requiring less dryer time
5.0,"""GREAT BUY!""","We have had our washer now for a few weeks. now and it works great. Plus it is very quiet. Our laundry room is on the 1st floor, so that is a very important feature for us. It does have quite a few settings, so we are still experimenting with different ones.It is very easy to use."
4.0,"""Samsung activewash washer""",We've had this for less than a week and I can already see that it's going to be a timesaver. Some of the load selections will go longer than an hour but when you figure in the size of stainless tub that more than makes up for it. 4 king size sheets = one load! I don't usually have 4 king size sheets but I was saving up to test the capacity.
5.0,"""great to use""","I love my new washer. Love the steam cycle, it is going to be so very helpful with not having to iron a lot of things I have always ironed.

This one is nice too but when there is a sock or something small on the bottom, I have to get a small stool or my arm stretcher out or just call for my 6 foot 6 inch tall husband...LOL [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
5.0,"""This. Washer. Is. Fantastic!""","I just got my washer and dryer today. It's been like Christmas morning and I was happy just watching the installation. I've run several loads already and let me tell you, this washer is the bomb! The built in sink is fabulous. It's great just to lift it up and your clothing goes right into the washer. My laundry room doesn't have a sink so it is great to have one attached to the washer. The digital display features are easy to use. The music that plays at the start/end of a load is so cute! Compared to my previous washer this one is SO quiet. I love that it doesn't shake the walls when it's running. So how can I give such a glowing review on something I just received? I had researched this model from the time I saw it at the store. It had everything I wanted in a washer and then some. So far it has already exceeded my expectations. Very satisfied customer!"

5.0,"""Very quiet""",We've only had this washer for approximate (45) days. Very impressed so far. It's so quiet that you hardly know it's running (as compared to our old washer). Hope the touch control pad holds up during the next few years.
5.0,"""Great capacity and quiet operation.""","Like everything about this product with the exception of the detergent drawer. If you forget to push it back in after filling and close the top lid, the drawer falls off. I can image that it will break if you do this too many times. Should be a better way to add detergent without worrying about breaking the detergent drawer."
4.0,"""Easy to use""",Works great. Lots of options. Wish I could change a few settings on pre selections.
5.0,"""This product has great features""",This washer is great and the pre-wash system is fantastic. The water usage is down to a minimal yet the clothes comes out out fantastic.

5.0,"""Great so far""","We've had the washer for about a week. The built-in sink isn't something I was looking for, but the washer came with a lot of other great features, so we chose it. I haven't used the sink yet, and probably will very little. I do wish the detergent dispenser was in a different place, it's hard to maneuver the way it is now. But the clothes are coming out clean and it runs very quietly."
5.0,"""Top Load Washer and Electric Dryer""",Love the Black Stainless Steel color; stainless steel drums; the overall sleek design; touch menu for both washer and dryer; quietness.

They make doing laundry a pleasant experience."
4.0,"""Excellent Washer""","Extremely quiet! If it weren't for the sloshing water sound, wouldn't even know it was running! Rings clothes out during the spin cycle well to assist drying of the clothes in less time. The sink built in is a perfect feature for pre-soaking. Great washer."

5.0,"""samsung washer""",Though we've only had this washer for a few weeks. My wife is very pleased with it. It is quiet and compared to our old washer does a better job cleaning our clothes.
5.0,"""Very nice""",Our experience with this washer has been great. A lot of options to run it and it is very large. We've had it for about a month and we've washed just about everything. It can complete three times the load of towels we used to be able to do. Runs very quietly and has done a great job for us.  We've had it unbalance on us twice with a blanket in the wash but it is easy to fix and finish - smart response and not a complaint.

4.0,"""Quiet washer & saves $$$""","I love my new washer, it is VERY QUIET! I love the active wash sink, it is VERY HANDY pre-treating stains and rinsing things that need rinsed. I don't have a sink in my laundry room, so problem solved! The only thing I don't like about it is the lack of control that you have on how much water you put in each load! Sometimes I feel there isn't enough water for the load, so before the machine ""locks"" I run some cold water from the active wash sink into the load to give it a better water level (in my mind anyway lol...). Also, you want to make sure that you get the stains out BEFORE you wash because these new machines don't agitate like the old ones. I'm sure that is a good thing, as it is easier on your clothes, but just check your clothes before you dry them! It does take some getting used to not being able to control things. I used to agitate my clothes for a minute or two, then switch to gentle cycle or permanent press. You can't really do that unless you start a load without soap...because if you stop the cycle and switch to another one, it drains the water and soap already in the basin out, so you just wasted your soap! Need I say I only did this once lol... Overall, I think it is a great machine. =)"

It was delivered today and I have to believe something is wrong with it because it hums louder than any washing machine I've ever owned including the 10 year old one I just replaced. I know some electrical hum is normal but this is ridiculous. I hate to think I just wasted my money. Please help.

5.0,"""Good Washer, But Needs Some Changes""","This is a great washer but needs some tweaks. The washer Model #WA50K8600AV/A2 could use louder alerts when cycle completes. Also, the bleach receptacle is too small. It allows dripping of the bleach directly onto the clothes in the washer."
5.0,"""Great features!!""",Installation was very easy and quick. I love all the features that this washer has. this is replacing a 16 year old kenmore front loading machine. It was great - never had any issues but when it finally quit working I decided to try a this Samsung top loader. It's been great so far - I did take out the extended warranty - just in case. Although I don't think I'll be needing it - my daughter has had a Samsung top loader for several years now and loves it.
5.0,"""Not your mother's washer""","This large capacity top load washer is not at all like the old models with the agitator and noisy mechanism. Many options to choose from to wash your load. Had one issue with a mixed load of towels and large polyester table cloths that did not spin properly, but it may have been user error. Otherwise, great washer."

It has Integrated Touch Control with a strunning sleek, contemporary design for the perfect blend of form and function. The 5.0-cu ft capacity get you more laundry done in less time. VTR Samsung's Vibration Reduction Technology creates a virtually silent washing experience, very quiet. Another great feature is Self Clean cycle helps to keep your laundry drum fresh and odor free without the use of harsh chemicals.

I have been very happy with this Samsung washer. I am enjoy this washer."

4.0,"""A lot of features""","I have never owned a Samsung appliance before purchasing this washer. My Cabrio series washer was failing and I was very unhappy with the lifespan. I did research and this washer was highly rated and reviewed so I decided to give it and the dryer a try. I got the washer first about a month ago and overall I am pretty happy with it. My only issue is that it does not seem to spin enough water out of the clothes on the high setting. It needs to be run again on extra high. I don't know if it is the water temp, the load size, or the washer itself. I still have high hopes and hope maybe I need to adjust settings. It is a beautiful machine with tons of features, the clothes come out clean and the beeps and alerts are pleasant. Oh and unlike machines of the past I can not leave clean, wet clothes in it overnight. They get the musty smell fast. But overall I am pretty happy with it."

The cycles run a bit longer than my older samsung front load washer did, but hopefully since it's newer, it will not use as much electricity. The only thing I would want different would be the location of the soap and fabric softener dispensers. You have to be careful or you will spill your laundry soap all over. My queen size comforter fit right into the washer which will save me from having to take it to the laundromat or dry cleaners."

3.0,"""WEIGHT OF LOAD DETERMINES IF WATER SPINS OUT""","I had a 5'2"" friend do the very first load by herself. She told me that she had to ""dive"" into the tub to get the clothes that were in the bottom of the tub. I chuckled because she is so short. I am 5'11"" and was sure I wouldn't have any problems. BUT...I did. Even I have to stand on my tiptoes to reach the very bottom for a sock with my outstretched fingers. Also, I don't like how the cup for liquid bleach is placed. It's angled. So when you pour the bleach in, you have to be very careful or it ends up overflowing toward the inside. I'm afraid it's going to overflow to the inside of the tub and directly onto my clothes! Also, the tub is EXTREMELY big (which I wanted specifically so I could easily wash queen/king size quilts and comforters). However, I put in 1 queen size sheet set, a queen size mattress pad, and 1 medium blanket. By that I mean that it wasn't a light blanket, but not extremely thick and heavy. After everything was in, the tub was 1/2-3/4 full. It started and washed fine. But I had a hard time hearing the ""alert tone"" in my basement. And when I went to check, it showed there was still time left. It was on the spin cycle but it had stopped. I tried to restart it but within seconds it stopped again. Apparently it was ""off balance"". Because when I tried it again, it knocked around a bit. So I rearranged everything and tried again. Again, it started and stopped within seconds.  So I got down into it and could feel that the load was extremely heavy and wet. So I removed the sheet set and rearranged the blanket and mattress pad and tried again. That was enough to allow the machine to complete the spin cycle.  I also do not like the inner ""sink"". I don't like how you have to lift it and dump the detergents and dirty water you've used, directly into the washer. I just wish it weren't there. I think the value would certainly be worth it if it could wash and spin a full load. I haven't had enough to make a full load of clothes yet. But I'm wondering if it will be able to handle it since the load I did wash was about half of it's capacity, and it couldn't spin all of the water out. I specifically did not put in a full load because I knew one blanket would be heavy when wet.  My problem is...if the huge tub isn't nearly full, why doesn't the machine have enough power to spin the water out of whatever is in it? It ""should' spin when it's completely loaded. But when a huge washing machine like this can not spin because of one blanket, or like in my case...the sheet set added just enough weight to be too much for it, then what's the point in buying a huge washer? Boo!"
5.0,"""Research paid off!""","I must have done 2-3 weeks of research trying to find the best of the best and it has paid off! They are sleek, quiet, efficient, economically manageable, and cut down on the number of loads and hours spent washing a family of 7's laundry. With many wash cycles to choose from, the digital display is easy to navigate. Although I have not had to use the soaking basin yet, I am almost encouraging the children to get a grass stain just to try it out!"
5.0,"""The joys of doing laundry!""",I went out in search of new washer to replace my worn out old machine that was no longer working and found the Samsung top loader.

I have been using it in my home now for about a month and am completely happy with my new purchase!

5.0,"""love this product""",the washer leaves very little water in the clothing. Takes less time to dry. The washer does everything they say it will. Love the different options for washing. Love the soaking tray.Overall it's a wonderful washer
4.0,"""great product""",It is very deep. Not made for short people. the washer is ideal for a large family. I went from a front loader to a top loader and I will never go back.
5.0,"""Really nice washer that gets the job done well every time""","I was hesitant to buy a washer without an agitator but I can say without doubt that Samsung has made me a believer. My clothes are cleaner and less beat up from this washer. I love the self clean function as well as the washer basin. I have two young children and one teenager and can say that I've already used it several times. The washer performs well, gets the water out on the spin cycle and has many options to suit all of your needs. I recommend this washer."
5.0,"""Awesome""","We love our new washing machine. We went from a front loader that was doing an awful job at washing our clothes and could not hold large loads to this Samsung. So far, our clothes are coming out much cleaner. I was worried that with all the bells and whistles, it would be too complicated. But, actually it is quite easy to use. Just push on the button for the type of load and it does all the other setting for you. The manual is also well written and simple to use when trying to figure out where your load of laundry falls. Most of all, we simply hit normal. My husband, who does oil field work uses heavy duty. The little song at the end of the load is very cute. It makes us smile. I would recommend this machine to everyone. When we get it paid off, we will look at the dryer. It is taller not wider than our old machine, so we had no problem fitting it in the space of the old washing machine."
5.0,"""Workhorse in a Tuxedo""","It sounds silly to say, but I love this clothes washer! The large, open tub makes it easy to fit large blankets and comforters, that previously required a trip to the local laundromat. The touch panel is a cinch to operate and has lots of wash features. The sleek, stylish appearance goes great in any home. The only negative I've found is that this model does not include a sanitizing steam wash."
5.0,"""Best Thing Out""",This is the quietest washer I have ever owned. I love this thing.
5.0,"""Quiet""",Super quiet and looks great. Love the size and wash sink.
4.0,"""GOOD FEATURES""","WASHER HAS GOOD FEATURES BUT COULD USE BETTER DESIGN.IT SEEMS TO WASH GOOD BUT THE TOP COVER MIGHT BE A POTENTIAL TOOL TO BREAK THE TRAYS WHERE THE SOUP AND SOFTER GOES.IF YOU DO NOT MAKE SURE YOU CLOSE/ PUSH IN THE TRAYS AND YOU CLOSE THE TOP, YOU MIGHT BREAK THE TRAYS.ALSO, THE WASHER IS DEEP AND THE CLOTHES IS HARD TO REACH.UNLESS YOU ARE TALL AND HAVE LONG LEGS AND ARMS, THE CLOTHES IS HARD TO REACH AFTER WASHER HAS FINISHED.OTHER THAN THAT...IT WORKS GREAT!!"
1.0,"""Defective faulty""",Too many error codes to deal with plus there has been a recall
5.0,"""This Washing Machine is very impressive!""","I would like to tell you how much myself and my family love our new Samsung Washing Machine. It was, according to my husband, very easy to install. We performed the Running the Test Cycle before using it and it went very well. Then we proceeded to do our laundry and really liked the ease of the controls and the many features that you can use to wash many different types of loads. When researching washers before purchasing this one, I read the many 5 Star Reviews on it and was very impressed. My own sister has this very same model washer and she loves it as well. We have lots of wash to do all the time and this new washing machine will do a great job for us. I would highly recommend this model to many family and friends and hoping that they will buy one when they need to replace theirs. Thank you for making such a great washer! When our dryer goes up we will be purchasing the dryer to go along with our new washing machine.When I called to speak with someone regarding registering our washer, I spoke with a very lovely young lady named Dorothy. She was very kind, and considerate and very knowledgeable and very helpful. She is a true asset to your company. Once again, we are very pleased with our new purchase and look forward to using this washer for many, many years to come."
5.0,"""Love this washer""",I have to say this is the greatest washer I have ever owned . The large tube allows for large loads to be washed and it performs wonderfully. Easy to use controls and performs great.

5.0,"""Very pleased!""","After having a front load that I didn't like at all I decided to get a top load. I was still hesitant because it is a new energy efficient one, but it uses plenty of waterand the water level covers the clothes. My clothes are way cleaner. Never going back to a front load. The stain basket is very useful also."
5.0,"""great product""",I have other Samsung products and all have performed without any problems I am sure the washer will perform as well as my other Samsung products.
5.0,"""Love it!""",I am very happy with my washer... It's a lot quieter than my last one.
5.0,"""So far so good! Like it a lot""","I had a front loader (different brand) and it was so smelly. I found out there was a recall for mold issues.Got on line, read reviews about samsung washers and got this one. Very nice looking, no noise at all, clothes finally smell fresh."
5.0,"""Washer does the job the first time""","New to the home, in a hall closet and just fits nicely, and does not make alot of noise. Just wish that the sound of the music when load is done was much louder. If i am standing by the washer, i can hear it, but if i am not there i can not hear it..I would like to have control on how loud it plays.."
5.0,"""Awesome Product""",Just tried out our new washer and we are very impressed so far. Our clothes smell good and seem to have fewer wrinkles. The machine is much quieter than our older one and we like that we can spin the barrel to make it easier to reach the clothes at the bottom.
5.0,"""Great product""",Excellent product and value and it has all the functions we required.
4.0,"""great product""",It is very deep. Not made for short people. the washer is ideal for a large family. I went from a front loader to a top loader and I will never go back.
5.0,"""Research paid off!""","I must have done 2-3 weeks of research trying to find the best of the best and it has paid off! They are sleek, quiet, efficient, economically manageable, and cut down on the number of loads and hours spent washing a family of 7's laundry. With many wash cycles to choose from, the digital display is easy to navigate. Although I have not had to use the soaking basin yet, I am almost encouraging the children to get a grass stain just to try it out!"
5.0,"""The joys of doing laundry!""",I went out in search of new washer to replace my worn out old machine that was no longer working and found the Samsung top loader. I was impressed by the size of the washing tub (read: fewer loads to do) and the looks of the model. I have been using it in my home now for about a month and am completely happy with my new purchase!
