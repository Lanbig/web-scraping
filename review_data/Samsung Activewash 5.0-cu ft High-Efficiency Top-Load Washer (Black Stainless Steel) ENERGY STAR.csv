5.0,"""Love! Love! Love!""","This is truly the best washer I've even owned.  Crazy but I'm so excited to do laundry!!!  I agree with all the complimentary technical info  other reviews stated. I have one minor issue but other consumers need to be aware of the depth of the drum.  I am 5'5"" and I still need to stand on tiptoes to reach items such as socks or small children's items.  One review mocked another person that had mentioned this issue,  but I do think it is relative to the prospective purchaser."
5.0,"""Best washer Yet!""",After much research we decided to purchase this washer. It washes clothes so clean and so much water removed takes no tune to dry.Very quite and easy to use.We replaced our 5 year old LG due to a rust problem LG says was cosmetic . Easy to use READ directionsGreat service from lowes and installers made sure it was level and ran checks b4 they left.  Cannot beat the price.This is one product we did invest in the 5 year warranty lowes offers at a reasonable price.
4.0,"""Jury is still out as we've only had it a few weeks""","It washes the clothes good and looks nice and the buttons are touch sensitive, not press sensitive so just touch them to activate them.  We are still learning the best settings for each type of clothes because it definitely is different from our old front loading washing machine.  The best thing about this machine is that it is quiet and can hold a lot of clothes.  No longer do I have to hear the loud noises from my old washer.  The biggest complaint I have so far is I can't seem to figure out which setting is best to prevent or decrease wrinkles for a normal load of laundry.  Many loads are coming out of the washing machine with a lot of wrinkles and my wife likes to hang dry many of our clothes and they have quite a few wrinkles in them and we both despise ironing.  We have put the clothes in the dryer for a few and they are a little better, but I wasn't expecting to run into this when we purchased this washer.  It is new and we are still learning it, so I don't want to sound like I'm negatively saying anything as it is probably just we haven't given sufficient time to figure everything out.  It works, there is not problems, and it washes clothes quietly.  That is sufficient for me for now.  Also if you are short you will need to buy a small step stool to reach into the bottom of the washer to get out the clothes.  My wife is 5' and she has to use a 5"" step stool to get everything out. I've also purchased the 5 year extended protection because my experience with any new appliance now a days is that they don't make them to last 20 years like they use to.  Usually if you get 5 to 10 years out of a new appliance you are doing good.  Hope this helps."
5.0,"""Very nice upgrade from a front loading HE machine""","We've had this machine for three weeks now and we've washed about 18 loads with it. It is like others have said, extremely quiet while operating. So far the clothes we've washed have come out very clean and it generally works fast to get the loads clean. The styling of it is modern. I've used the active wash sink a few times and I like the convenience it offers. As for the installation: We have a shelf above the machine on the wall. You should make sure that you have 61"" of space above the washer in order for the door to open and remain opened. It fit just in our space which was positive. Overall, I'm very happy with the style and the functionality of this machine. The capacity is huge. I've washed a sleeping bag in it already with no problems. It will hold all of our towels for the week. We've also been able to combine our children's clothes in with our parent loads so we are washing fewer loads each week. Highly recommend this item."
1.0,"""Do NOT Buy!""","We purchased this washer and dryer set May of 2016, due partly to the great reviews. The washer completely stopped working only 5 months later! It will not even turn on! Samsung customer service was absolutely awful to me! I went round and round with them for 6 days straight. After 2 weeks of not having a washer and having to wash my son's clothes by hand, I went in to Lowes and begged for help. They agreed to take them both back and get me into a different brand because I will no longer buy anything Samsung! Lowes was amazing! I will buy all of my appliances from Lowes but will NEVER buy Samsung again!"
2.0,"""Give it time""","I purchased the earlier model in December 2014. It's now September 2016 and the pulsator cap on the washer's tub came off. It's a cap in the very center of the bottom of the tub. In the attached photo, it's located in the very center of what looks like an airplane propeller.  When it broke, it exposed the clothes to a bare nut that holds the tub in place, or maybe the bottom of the tub in place (not a washer repair guy so forgive me). The washer came with a 3 year warranty on the tub. When I phoned Samsung I was told that the pulsator cap wasn't part of the tub warranty and was covered for only one year. I explained that the cap is in fact part of the tub because it's located IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TUB. They refused to replace the part under warranty. So, yes it's a great washer for the 21 months it held together but buyer beware. It's either a design flaw or just shoddy workmanship. Either way it's poor customer service."
2.0,"""Poor washer""",This washer has been a complete disappointment. It has ripped our clothes and twists them in knots that require ironing clothes I never had to iron before. On top of that it has broken two times in 6 months. Right now I'm sitting in my laundry room surrounded by piles of dirty laundry--trying to figure out how to pack for a trip because I know the repairman will never make it on time (from my previous experience with this broken washer). I'm wishing I'd never bought this washer. Buyer beware.
1.0,"""This Model is under recall! Do not purchase.""","I bought this washer 6 months ago, for  $899.00 with an extended warranty. Shortly thereafter it was recalled voluntarily by Samsung, because the top of the washer can separate from the machine during the spin cycle and cause damage and injury. Samsung is only willing to give me $749.00 towards a replacement Samsung washer, or I can choose to have a DISH repairman come out and reinforce the top. Reports from people that have had the repairs done are generally negative. Lowe's has not offered any assistance at all with this problem. It is a discouraging situation. Even though this appears to be a fabulous machine at a great price, don't be tempted. It won't be worth the aggravation!  https://pages.samsung.com/us/tlw/"
1.0,"""wast of money do not buy""",got a Samsung in may of 2015. it stopped working by 9/2016. wont start at all. Now i have a $700 repair bill. i would never buy a Samsung again. would give it
4.0,"""Loud pump motor or I would rate it five stars!""",There is a a lot to like about this latest design on the Active Wash 5-cu ft Top load series washer.  The other reviews cover everything you want to know about it really.  The surprizing thing I found when we got ours delivered is how noisy it is at times because of how loud the pump motor in the spin cycle.  People say the washer is quiet and it is on all the cycle oporations except when the water is being drained in the spin cycle. So if that issue ever gets addressed then I think the machine would deserve a five star rating.
1.0,"""Don't buy a Samsung Washer.  5yr lifespan.""","Purchased a Samsung WA5471ABW top load high efficiency washer in 08/2011.  Purchased 5yr extended warranty as well.  Here it is 10/28/16 and the washer is broken.  Not only that it is subject to a pending recall for exploding on the Spin cycle with a heavy load.  I fortunately 'or so I thought' purchased an extension on my 5yr warranty for $122.95 in July '16.  However, Lowes uses subpar repairmen to work on your product.  The first one had an 'F' rating on the BBB website so I rescheduled with a second one and now this one isn't showing up.  So forget the extended warranty.  It's worthless.  Samsung doesn't last.  Now keep in mind.  You're washer will wash like a champ for 5yrs.  Then it's game over.  If you only expect 5yrs then buy a Samsung.  If you're hoping for better look at another brand.  Just make sure you wash your bedding on the Gentle Cycle only."

2.0,"""NOT FOR BEDDING""",EVERYTIME I WASH BEDDING THE SHEETS GET TANGLED UP AND THE SPIN CYCLE DOESNT WORK VERY GOOD MY BEDDING BE SOAKED
5.0,"""5-cu ft !!!""","I see few fox gave only  4 stars for something I personally consider to be a big advantage : “5.0-cu ft capacity” . Come on guys! People want to know about the washer, not about your issues with your height :-)"
1.0,"""Don't ever buy a Samsung washer or dryer""","Nightmare, I purchased this washer and dryer set July 2016, return one set had the same problem out of the second washer now it is on recall can't get any satisfaction from Samsung I was told they will replace the washer not the dryer, my problem is now you want me to have a set that's not matching I refuse ever to buy a Samsung Appliance again, I've been talking with them sense October 2016 it's now February 2017 still nothing has been done, now I feel I'm being forced to purchase this machine again just to have a matching set."
2.0,"""Sink is nice, but that's the only benefit""","The washer does not clean that well. Also, it does have many options, however, you are often unable to mix and match different settings (for example, you can't soak if you use the delicate cycle). I have had it for a year and a half and am replacing it with a different brand."
5.0,"""STUNNING!""","Not only is this a BEAUTIFUL looking machine, it works BEAUTIFULLY! I AM IMPRESSED."
5.0,"""Smart and Easy to Use""",I just got it today. I used Washer and was amazed at amount of clothing it can handle. I also like the Wash settings that make choosing cycle easy. I love that it senses load size to automatically fill water to correct level. Working great and happy I chose this for my new Washer.
5.0,"""Best Washer I've Owned""",I just purchased this washer and am very happy with it so far. The first day I ran several loads using the Super Speed function and it works as advertised. I'm looking forward to using the Active Wash function.
5.0,"""Best Washer I've Ever Used""","I bought this washer to replace an old one that had run its course. The main things I was looking for was a washer that was big enough to handle heavy loads and one with a digital setup. This unit has both and then some. It is extremely easy to use. I would have given it 5 stars all around except that the drain hose that comes attached to the unit was too short to reach my drain pipe and there was no way to remove it to hook up a longer hose that I already had. I had to purchase another hose and then attach it to the Samsung hose to make it long enough to reach the drain pipe. The pros definitely outweigh the cons though. If you're thinking of getting this unit just keep in mind where your drain pipe is; you may need to extend it. But that aside, I'm very happy with the washer and would recommend it to anyone!"
5.0,"""Set & Forget!""","My husband and I love our new Samsung Washer. The black stainless finish is sleek and beautiful. The size of the drum is HUGE and I even need to get a small step stool just so I can reach the stuff in the bottom {I'm 5'4""}. I love all of the wash settings and the fact that I can throw my clothes in there and it auto-senses the load size means that I am not wasting a bunch of water. It's nice and quiet too! I especially love the little music tones Samsung designed letting you know the cycle is finished. This washer goes fabulously with their dryer and makes our lives much easier!!"
5.0,"""Need to measure""","Products were really to big for a small laundry area. They do not sit back far enough if you have above cabinets over them (lid on washer will not stay up due to bumping cabinet). If dryer vent is in floor, it will not sit far back making it difficult to open door in small spaces. Otherwise, a great product and overall happy with the general use of it."
4.0,"""Form and Function""","This machine is sleek, modern and has everything including the bathroom sink. The redesigned pretreat basin is handy for those of us who do not have a laundry room with a sink. It clips out of the way when not in use and the water enters from the left rather than the rear. The tub itself is stainless steel and I like the self clean function especially after finishing a grimy load. The electronic board is intuitive, easy to use and the machne runs so quietly I had to double check to make sure it was running. There is something of a learning curve even after reading the manual. The manual and Samsung's online helpline are indispensable. It seems some loads could use more water. HE detergent is a must. My first two loads of towels and underwear came up a little stiff compared to my previous washer. But I am experimenting with different settings and will then program the ""my cycle"" function. An unexpected treat is the little chime it rings instead of a buzzer. There is also a phone app I downloaded that helps read error codes on the machine. I hope I won't be needing that. I would have given this washer five stars except that the bottom of the drum is difficult to reach and this model does not have a steam function or a setting for wool. The real test of this machine will be the test of time. My last one lasted 27 years. I start counting today. If I could I would come back in 6 months with an update."
5.0,"""One Month with normal use""","This washer performs as advertised. Fast and efficient. Quiet and clothes are clean.Vast improvement over 10 year old front load machine.Touch controls work well. Very deep drum, can offer difficulty to reach articles in bottom for some people. Great product. Hope it holds up and stands test of time."
5.0,"""Happy to be back with a top loader""","This washer is replacing my 8 year old front loader. I have only had it for a couple of days and I love doing laundry!!! We have a large family, 7 people, and I can fit so much in 1 load it is amazing. Also my king size comforter I've always had to take to the laundry mat, fit with ease and came out super clean.  I have not used the built in sink yet. Love love my new washer"
5.0,"""GREAT BUY!""","We have had our washer now for a few weeks. now and it works great. Plus it is very quiet. Our laundry room is on the 1st floor, so that is a very important feature for us. It does have quite a few settings, so we are still experimenting with different ones.It is very easy to use."
4.0,"""Samsung activewash washer""",We've had this for less than a week and I can already see that it's going to be a timesaver. Some of the load selections will go longer than an hour but when you figure in the size of stainless tub that more than makes up for it. 4 king size sheets = one load! I don't usually have 4 king size sheets but I was saving up to test the capacity.
5.0,"""great to use""","I love my new washer. Love the steam cycle, it is going to be so very helpful with not having to iron a lot of things I have always ironed. Love being able to wash my king size comfort, blankets, etc, at home and not have to go to a laundry mat to do this. If you are a short person like I am you will need a little step stool to use to get things in and out of the bottom of the washer, arms are not long enough."
5.0,"""Great product""","Washer is easy to use, self explanatory when needing to find the setting for the load you're washing. Size of the drum is very nice."

5.0,"""Last washer I'll ever need""","I was a bit skeptical when purchasing a new top loading he washing machine, but Samsung made the switch easy.

4.0,"""Good product""","This washing machine is nice. It works great and I haven't had any issues with it yet except for the recall, which has been a little frustrating to say the least.

5.0,"""This washer has everything""","I've only done about 6 loads,but it does everything it says. It's easy to use, but I do read the manual. I love it so far & it's fun to work with. I've been doing large loads because that's why I got this washer & it works great. I'm also doing delicate & I love the sink. I wasn't interested at first,I thought it would be in the way, but then I realized I have a lot of hand wash items I can now do in the washer. It's also a very quiet washer. I got a lot more in a washer than I ever expected for the price I paid."

5.0,"""Awesome Washer""",I absolutely love this washer machine. My only complaint is that I almost have to lay down on it to get the items out of the bottom of the machine due to the largeness of it. I love that I don't have to wash as often--it saves a lot of time!

5.0,"""Very quiet""",We've only had this washer for approximate (45) days. Very impressed so far. It's so quiet that you hardly know it's running (as compared to our old washer). Hope the touch control pad holds up during the next few years.
5.0,"""Great capacity and quiet operation.""","Like everything about this product with the exception of the detergent drawer. If you forget to push it back in after filling and close the top lid, the drawer falls off. I can image that it will break if you do this too many times. Should be a better way to add detergent without worrying about breaking the detergent drawer."
4.0,"""Easy to use""",Works great. Lots of options. Wish I could change a few settings on pre selections.

5.0,"""Great so far""","We've had the washer for about a week. The built-in sink isn't something I was looking for, but the washer came with a lot of other great features, so we chose it. I haven't used the sink yet, and probably will very little. I do wish the detergent dispenser was in a different place, it's hard to maneuver the way it is now. But the clothes are coming out clean and it runs very quietly."

5.0,"""Very nice""",Our experience with this washer has been great. A lot of options to run it and it is very large. We've had it for about a month and we've washed just about everything. It can complete three times the load of towels we used to be able to do. Runs very quietly and has done a great job for us.  We've had it unbalance on us twice with a blanket in the wash but it is easy to fix and finish - smart response and not a complaint.

4.0,"""Quiet washer & saves $$$""","I love my new washer, it is VERY QUIET! I love the active wash sink, it is VERY HANDY pre-treating stains and rinsing things that need rinsed. I don't have a sink in my laundry room, so problem solved! The only thing I don't like about it is the lack of control that you have on how much water you put in each load! Sometimes I feel there isn't enough water for the load, so before the machine ""locks"" I run some cold water from the active wash sink into the load to give it a better water level (in my mind anyway lol...). Also, you want to make sure that you get the stains out BEFORE you wash because these new machines don't agitate like the old ones. I'm sure that is a good thing, as it is easier on your clothes, but just check your clothes before you dry them! It does take some getting used to not being able to control things. I used to agitate my clothes for a minute or two, then switch to gentle cycle or permanent press. You can't really do that unless you start a load without soap...because if you stop the cycle and switch to another one, it drains the water and soap already in the basin out, so you just wasted your soap! Need I say I only did this once lol... Overall, I think it is a great machine. =)"

It was great - never had any issues but when it finally quit working I decided to try a this Samsung top loader. It's been great so far - I did take out the extended warranty - just in case.

My only issue is that it does not seem to spin enough water out of the clothes on the high setting. It needs to be run again on extra high. I don't know if it is the water temp, the load size, or the washer itself. I still have high hopes and hope maybe I need to adjust settings. It is a beautiful machine with tons of features, the clothes come out clean and the beeps and alerts are pleasant.

The cycles run a bit longer than my older samsung front load washer did, but hopefully since it's newer, it will not use as much electricity. The only thing I would want different would be the location of the soap and fabric softener dispensers. You have to be careful or you will spill your laundry soap all over. My queen size comforter fit right into the washer which will save me from having to take it to the laundromat or dry cleaners."

5.0,"""Best washer we have ever owned""","Samsung - Activewash 5.0 Cu. Ft. 12-Cycle Top-Loading Washer - Black Stainless SteelModel: WA50K8600AV Let me start by saying my wife loves this washer and the matching dryer. This is a large capacity high efficiency washer with 12 cycles, there is no agitator and you must use detergent designed for high efficiency washers. These soaps have been formulated to produce less suds and we discovered that most laundry detergents now meet this requirement, look on the detergent container for the “HE” label. You can choose a cycle from the selection of 12 or you can customize your own cycle and save it as “My Cycle,” the next time you want to use your custom cycle simply press the “My Cycle” button. The control panel sits almost flat towards the back of the machine, no big bulky timer knob, simply small electronic touch buttons, no need to press on them, just lay your finger on the switch to select the function. Due to their positioning I was a bit concerned it might be difficult to see and identify the buttons and labels but they are actually very visible. There is also a display that gives you an estimate of how much longer the load will be running, this didn't sound all that impressive but we actually find it very useful. When the washer completes a load of clothes it turns the power completely off, to start the next load you must first press the power button, then select your options and when you are ready press the start/pause button for 3 seconds. The washer has a built-in sink with a scrub basin that the wife was not sure she wanted, she seldom does hand washing but she has discovered this is actually a very nice feature. Works great for placing shirts on it to spray the collars or if you want to hand scrub something place it in the sink, press the switch on the left hand side to add water, complete your scrubbing and then lift the built-in sink, the water and the item fall out the back directly into the washer, nicely designed. When you begin the wash cycle the lid locks closed, if you then decide you want to add something you simply press the start/pause button, the washer will pause and the lid will unlock, add your item, close the lid and press start/pause button. During the wash cycle it swishes the clothes back and forth without the use of an agitator. We know they are swishing because we can see the action via the tinted window in the lid. I don't know this as a fact but I believe not having an agitator has multiple benefits, your clothes won't wear as quickly due to rubbing on the agitator nor will they get wrapped around it causing your wash loads to be out of balance. Speaking of balance, I don't fully understand how it works but this washer automatically balances the load. We loaded it up with a bunch of rugs that would have given our old washer major balance problems and this washer ran quiet and kept the load in balance. It offers a number of spin speeds and I can tell you it does a really good job of spinning the water out of the clothes.  I guess the most important part of a washer is do the clothes come out clean. We have not had any really nasty loads of clothes to throw at it but everything we have washed from shirts to whites have been great. Depending on your height and the length of your arms getting your clothes out of the washer can be a challenge, my wife it 5'5” and she can barely reach the bottom of the washer. Our previous washer was 23 inches deep from the top of the washer to the bottom of the tub, the new washer is 29 inches deep. The washer even has a self clean mode, according to the directions every month or so the self clean LED will light and you should run the washer in self clean mode, it is designed to remove mold and dirt that might be trapped or growing in the machine. This washer is really quiet, our old washer made so much noise when it was running we had to keep the laundry room door closed, with this washer we can leave the door open and we never hear it. There is a button to turn a chime melody on that plays when the load is complete, unfortunately the volume is so low you can't hear it in another room. Very nice feature but really needs to be louder.   While not being important to the actual performance of the machines my wife also loves the appearance. In the past we have had a limited amount of stainless items and have never been impressed but the black stainless steel look is terrific. The finish on these appliances is spectacular, it is almost a shame to hide them away in a laundry room. The rest of the design is also very appealing.  The lid opens from the front to the back, if you happen to have a shelf or a cabinet above the washer you might have a clearance issue. With the lid open the washer is about 60 inches tall, the lid hit my cabinet but I was able to slide the washer far enough forward that it no longer reached the cabinet. Every time my wife has used her new washer and dryer she has told me how much she likes them. Very happy wife.

The activewash 5.0 gets my clothes cleaner than they have been in awhile. It runs so quit I don't even know I am washing clothes. The controls are easy to use and understand what you are setting the wash cycle on. You will not regret your decision after giving this washing machine a chance.

Who knew that the old washers beat your clothes clean and this one does a gentle swish. The clothes will not be worn out from getting them clean. The washer is super deep and has such a selection of cycles. Love it!!!!!
4.0,"""Hand wash bowl""",I bought mainly for the hand wash feature as no sink in laundry room. Washer is extremely quiet-can't tell when running. So nice as my last washer sounded like a airplane landing. Just got so gave a 4 star as have only used twice.
5.0,"""Awesome Washer""","After our front load machine with several issues died after 6 yrs . We decided to go back to a top load machine and chose Samsung ! Wow.. so glad we did ! I labeled this washer our Smart Washer because it's just that. It automatically does alot... balancing the load, senses weight and makes adjustments accordingly. But most of all... this washer is very, very quiet ! As a matter of fact, so quiet that I had to walk up to it to make sure it was washing ! Love this machine !"
5.0,"""So Awesome!!!""","I purchased this washer a few days ago when my old one bit the dust, and I must say that I am more than pleased with this awesome machine! It is super quiet and so big, I was able to wash my king sized comforter at home for the first time ever,  I usually have to take it to the laundromat, but this machine took the comforter and still had room to put something else in (but i didn't)! I am so happy and satisfied with this washer, I also purchased the dryer but the store only had electric ones in stock and I need a gas one. I am more than confident that I will love the dryer as much as this washing machine. The little jingle it plays when the load is done amuses my little one, so that is a plus as well."
5.0,"""Great Looking Product""",We just received our new washer and it looks fantastic. Running thru the setup now and will update if there are any issues.
5.0,"""Excited about our new washer""","We havent had it very long, but it seems wonderful. Runs so quietly and has a large capacity"
5.0,"""Excellent washing machine""","It does an outstanding job of getting the clothes clean. What a difference this machine makes compared to our older machine. There are two issues with it that we have. One, it is rather tall and if are under 5 feet, 5 inches tall, you will find it rather difficult to reach the bottom of the drum to remove washed clothes. The second issue is that extra tub for hand washing clothes. Very nice feature but I have hit my head on it trying to reach the bottom of the drum to remove washed clothes."
5.0,"""Great Washer and Dryer Set""","The color of this set is great, love the matte finish. Quiet and efficient models."

5.0,"""Used for first time""",Ran my first load and love how easy it is use use. Clothes came out great and did not take too long. So far very satisfied!
5.0,"""Love it!!""","My old whirlpool washer broke and I was more excited to go shopping since Samsung has the best on the market right now. Went to a few stores and all the sales people only recommended getting a Samsung. The front loaders were to deep for the space I had but this toploader was perfect fit! Not only is the spice cycle quite but the controls are easy to set and there is a ton of space to wash a full load. This washer even has a water proof cycle option (mattress pads, sleeping bags, rain coats etc). Very happy with my purchase!! I can't wait to continue to build my Samsung appliance collection!"
5.0,"""Front load no more""","We love our new activewash washer, the sink part is great when you get that spot on your jeans, dress or shirt. The washer is so quit and with the load sensor it stays balanced so well. A great option for any home."

5.0,"""Easy to use""","I didn't want a new washer but it has been easy to use. I like it very much. However, I just found out yesterday about the recall and I'm not happy about it. However, I haven't noticed any noise or vibrations when using the Bedding cycle. I've had no issues."

5.0,"""I like it!""",Nice design; love the scrubby tub on top to pre-treat.
2.0,"""Unbalanced""",It doesn't matter if I have a full load or a small load... I continue to get an error code halfway through a wash cycle that it has stopped because of an unbalanced load. I have to keep checking on the wash because it will just stop and leave everything soaking wet and I have to respond or restart the whole load over just to get my clothes washed. It's very frustrating and I end up using more water and soap just to get things washed
5.0,"""Nice features, very quiet""","Love everything about this washer so far. Quiet, holds tons of clothes and has some great features."
5.0,"""Research paid off!""","I must have done 2-3 weeks of research trying to find the best of the best and it has paid off! They are sleek, quiet, efficient, economically manageable, and cut down on the number of loads and hours spent washing a family of 7's laundry. With many wash cycles to choose from, the digital display is easy to navigate. Although I have not had to use the soaking basin yet, I am almost encouraging the children to get a grass stain just to try it out!"
5.0,"""The joys of doing laundry!""",I went out in search of new washer to replace my worn out old machine that was no longer working and found the Samsung top loader. I was impressed by the size of the washing tub (read: fewer loads to do) and the looks of the model. I have been using it in my home now for about a month and am completely happy with my new purchase!

4.0,"""great product""",It is very deep. Not made for short people. the washer is ideal for a large family. I went from a front loader to a top loader and I will never go back.
5.0,"""Really nice washer that gets the job done well every time""","I was hesitant to buy a washer without an agitator but I can say without doubt that Samsung has made me a believer. My clothes are cleaner and less beat up from this washer. I love the self clean function as well as the washer basin. I have two young children and one teenager and can say that I've already used it several times. The washer performs well, gets the water out on the spin cycle and has many options to suit all of your needs. I recommend this washer."
5.0,"""Awesome""","We love our new washing machine. We went from a front loader that was doing an awful job at washing our clothes and could not hold large loads to this Samsung. So far, our clothes are coming out much cleaner. I was worried that with all the bells and whistles, it would be too complicated. But, actually it is quite easy to use. Just push on the button for the type of load and it does all the other setting for you. The manual is also well written and simple to use when trying to figure out where your load of laundry falls. Most of all, we simply hit normal. My husband, who does oil field work uses heavy duty. The little song at the end of the load is very cute. It makes us smile. I would recommend this machine to everyone. When we get it paid off, we will look at the dryer. It is taller not wider than our old machine, so we had no problem fitting it in the space of the old washing machine."
5.0,"""Workhorse in a Tuxedo""","It sounds silly to say, but I love this clothes washer! The large, open tub makes it easy to fit large blankets and comforters, that previously required a trip to the local laundromat. The touch panel is a cinch to operate and has lots of wash features. The sleek, stylish appearance goes great in any home. The only negative I've found is that this model does not include a sanitizing steam wash."

5.0,"""Washer does the job the first time""","New to the home, in a hall closet and just fits nicely, and does not make alot of noise. Just wish that the sound of the music when load is done was much louder. If i am standing by the washer, i can hear it, but if i am not there i can not hear it..I would like to have control on how loud it plays.."

5.0,"""This Washing Machine is very impressive!""","I would like to tell you how much myself and my family love our new Samsung Washing Machine. It was, according to my husband, very easy to install. We performed the Running the Test Cycle before using it and it went very well. Then we proceeded to do our laundry and really liked the ease of the controls and the many features that you can use to wash many different types of loads. When researching washers before purchasing this one, I read the many 5 Star Reviews on it and was very impressed. My own sister has this very same model washer and she loves it as well. We have lots of wash to do all the time and this new washing machine will do a great job for us. I would highly recommend this model to many family and friends and hoping that they will buy one when they need to replace theirs. Thank you for making such a great washer! When our dryer goes up we will be purchasing the dryer to go along with our new washing machine.When I called to speak with someone regarding registering our washer, I spoke with a very lovely young lady named Dorothy. She was very kind, and considerate and very knowledgeable and very helpful. She is a true asset to your company. Once again, we are very pleased with our new purchase and look forward to using this washer for many, many years to come."

5.0,"""Very pleased!""","After having a front load that I didn't like at all I decided to get a top load. I was still hesitant because it is a new energy efficient one, but it uses plenty of waterand the water level covers the clothes. My clothes are way cleaner. Never going back to a front load. The stain basket is very useful also."
