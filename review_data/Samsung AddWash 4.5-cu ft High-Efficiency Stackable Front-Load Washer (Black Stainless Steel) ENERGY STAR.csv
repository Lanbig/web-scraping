3.0,"""Great washer, but don't stack this set""","Love the washer, although it's annoying when it plays music all the time.  The main problem is that I bought this set to stack, ordering sight-unseen online.  Unfortunately the control panels tilt backwards about 20 degrees which is fine if they are on a pedestal, but with this set stacked it's impossible to see the dryer controls without a stepladder.  My home was flooded out with 4 feet in the WV floods and I rushed to get the laundry room flooring in so we could finally wash clothes again, or else I'd have returned them."
5.0,"""Excellent Washer""",Purchased this washer a couple weeks ago. So far it does an excellent job. Very easy to use. I wipe around the edge where it builds up water and stick a couple paper towels to absorb the excess water and also take the tray where the detergent goes and wipe it out. The last one I got built up mildew and I didn't like that. Hopefully they've improved this but just in case I didn't' want to take a chance. Purchased a base for it but it comes in this week. I need some storage and it's too low not to have one.
5.0,"""Great deal""","I am still trying to get used to this washer. I have to read the instructional manual each time I use the washer., but the clothes are amazingly clean. Glad I made the purchase."
2.0,"""Less than Thrilled""","Bought the washer and dryer set in July. In November the washer began not working properly. Press start, it would lock the door, but not start the cycle. Called Lowe's and was referred to their Service Line. Was handed off to Samsung (will call within three days.) Samsung never called and when I called Lowe's Service, was told Samsung had arranged an appointment for Dec 13th, two weeks after my initial call. Washer is now leaking. Service for a five month old washer is terrible."
1.0,"""Samsung AddWash""","I just bought this washing machine and dryer slightly over a month ago.  After almost a month, there was a slow leak.  The company that serviced it thought it was coming from the door but there was no other leak since then.  About a week and half later, the machine wouldn't drain.  I restarted the cycle and again it wouldn't drain.  I manually drained it.  Then started the cycle over again and water came gushing out of the bottom.  I have talked to three different managers at Lowes.  They said that since it was a week over the 30 days they would not return it.  Then I called the Samsung service department to get someone to fix it and the company they gave me will not come out until 5 days later.  Very disappointed."
1.0,"""Sooooooo disappointed... Washer First Load Failure""","We had such great hope and excitement as we took delivery of the Samsung Front Load washer and dryer “of our dreams”…  Then we did the first load of wash  with it.   6 or 7 minutes into the first load cycle, the machine started beeping and we got a “4C” error code on the faceplate.   We read the manual and it said it was either a water supply issue or a drain issue. Verifying water pressure was not the issue, we checked the hoses, all fine and none kinked, checked the drain hose and water was coming out the hose and into the drain pipe.   Followed the manual and proceeded to let it sit 2-3 minutes and restart the cycle… again, 6-7 minutes into the cycle a 4C code.    So now we decide to get the water out of the unit and remove the clothes to do the load my GFs mom's house and call Samsung.    The unit continues to fill and the drum turned.  It seemed longer than it should be so I was watching the unit and noticed water coming out of the bottom of the Add Door and dripping down the front of the washer.   I opened to Add On door to see what was going on and water began pouring out the Add Door and all over our new Pergo Floor….   We immediately unplug the unit to avoid electrical shock, Shop Vac the water out of the drum, remove the clothing through the Add Door and drain the water out of the unit.   Placed a call to Lowe's (where we bought it… and they were fantastic and very responsive).   They took the units back and we have new Samsung top loader washer and matching dryer on order.   Yes, we went with Samsung again (every TV in the house is a Samsung)… even BEFORE we called customer service.   I placed an email to Samsung about the possible floor damage and the fact we had the issue with the first load of a brand new Washer, also asking for a free extended warranty on the new units to restore my faith in Samsung.   I received a phone call today, acknowledging my email,  that they documented the possibility of future floor warpage or mold, and the fact they would not address an extended warranty, even though I was an extremely loyal Samsung customer.   Disappointed to say the least.    If they had just given us the extended warranty, I would have rated the unit and Samsung 5 stars…   I truly hope we have no issues with the Top Loader or Samsung has probably lost a lifelong customer…."
1.0,"""EPIC FAILURE PT 2""",Purchased 18 Jun7 August machine is pouring water and flooded my laundry room.Called to get fixed. Forwarded to Samsung since it's under warranty. Working with SAMSUNG for 3 days to identify a repair center that will fix this.*If you stack this washer unit they will not fix it. You will have to have them unstacked yourself.*I am warning you that any service you may want to have done in the future will require you*to unstack them on your own and then restack them when the repair is complete. Needless to say i'm not pleased with the quality and durability of the machine. I'm even more disappointed with Lowes and Samsung customer service. #EPICFAILURE #LEMON #TELLALLYOURFRIENDS
2.0,"""Pick another brand""","I've had this washer for about 6 months now, and I really wish I hadn't spent so much money on a washing machine that is no better than other washers. I've had nothing but problems since receiving this washer. The first one I got had to be returned because of uncontrollable shaking. The one I have now doesn't shake but the small door got stuck and the washer wouldn't start so I had to pull it hard and a plastic piece fell off. Now we have to hold the door shut when we start the washer. Also the little door is overrated. You have to stop the washer to put anything in the small door and it's easier to open the regular door to the washer when not in use. I wish I had went for a less expensive and more reliable brand."
1.0,"""Flooded my laundry room!""",First time I ran this machine it leaked everywhere from the back and sides of the unit flooding my laundry room.  Waiting to hear from Samsung still but so far Lowe's has been helpful.  Will be looking for a new machine since leaking sounds to be a common issue with these.
5.0,"""Very good.""",We bought this machine a week ago and we really like it.  It is so quiet and cleans great.  It is easy to use and with the storage underneath it is easy to load an unload.  The add wash feature it is very useful if you forget something. The clothes come out less wrinkled then the top loaders. Really quiet.
1.0,"""Another letdown by Samsung""","Despite knowing better than to be burned by Samsung again as our previous Samsung washer and dryer were both repaired on multiple occasions, we chose to go with Samsung again after the washer finally failed. Spent Father's Day waiting on the new set to be delivered, and less than 24 hours later the washer is not working. So the consumer will once again be spending a day away from work not being paid to wait for another one to be installed once it becomes available. Of course its not just work time and money lost, family time and more money will be gone as we spend our evenings at the laundry mat. Beyond disappointed."
5.0,"""Best Decision""","It took me two years to pull the trigger on purchasing a new washer and dryer.  I did my research and decided to go with a front load instead of a top loader because of the gentleness on the clothes.  I wasn't fond of not being able to add laundry to a front loader as I am always finding stray socks, etc that need to go in after I have started a cycle.  This Samsung is what we chose and boy was it a great decision.  I was conflicted on the steam cycle, is it a gimmic? Well, today I got my answer.  My daughter came home from school sick, she had vomit all over a brand new pair of paints that had a white pattern.  I put them in a normal cycle, it still had a noticeable spot on the front of them, then I put them in the steam cycle.  They look brand new!!!  She was so happy that she gets to wear her pants again.  Other than this, it is a quiet machine, our water bill has decreased by $10-15 per month, looks fantastic.  We purchased the matching dryer and I love them both."
5.0,"""This machine is glorious.""","I upgraded to this from my old agitator style washer.  I was a little nervous because of all the problems I read about with front loaders.  But so far, I have nothing but praise for this one.  I have been able to wash things without damaging them or shrinking them for the first time in years.  Sweaters? BOOM, done. Huge down alternative comforters? BOOM, done.  Work uniforms and workout attire that just smell kind of funky because of dried sweat?  BOOM, done.  If you take the time and read the manual and really think about what cycle you choose, everything comes out great and so fresh. I also use the steam setting and up the spoil setting if I think a load is specially stinky. That helps a lot.  There was one time when I tried to just a normal cycle on a sweaty uniform, and it didn't come out great, so definitely pay attention to the settings you use.  The same uniform ran in the heavy soiled cycle with steam came out smelling wonderful. I can't stop smelling my clothes.  I'm also amazed that the more powerful settings don't seem to damage my clothes or shrink them.  I also love the allergy cycle, which was one of the main features I wanted in my new washer.  It's wonderful and my sheets come out so fresh.  I usually try to wash all my loads back to back whenever possible, and I carefully dry out the rubber seal in the door and the detergent canisters after I'm done using it.  I haven't had any trouble with mildew smells, and my house is pretty much a breeding house for mold (it's shaded and we live in a humid area).  Another thing I like is the end of cycle music.  It's a happy tune that sounds like an ice cream truck. I leave it on, but it also can be turned off.  I was happy also that the delivery guys left me the shipping bolts when I asked.  They are huge so I hope I can figure out how to put them in when I move again.  The only thing I am having a little trouble with is getting it balanced perfectly.  There's just this one part in the rinse cycle where it jerks a few times violently, despite being perfectly sturdy and not wobbling any other time.  Adjusting the feet doesn't seem to be something you can do yourself, because the washer is so heavy.  You also need a tiny wrench to do it.  The only thing a normal wrench will do is adjust the plastic shield that fits over the actual metal part you need to adjust. It seems like you actually need one of those flat metal wrenches (the type that often comes in the page of things you need to assemble).  I might call Lowe's and see if they can send someone out again.  My house is older so I think the floor might not be perfectly level.The matching dryer is very powerful.  Most of my loads with the exception of bedding are not that big, so the dryer really seems to dry everything FAST.  It's a little concerning that the dryer won't end the cycle even though the clothes are dry.  So I've been getting the hang of it and getting my clothes out earlier.  During the first week of using it I was still worried about shrinking my clothes because that's what my old dryer used to do, so I would use the low heat setting.  I found out that the low heat setting on this dryer doesn't have very much heat at all and you actually are fine using medium heat.  Nothing has shrinked so far."
1.0,"""Horrible""","This washing machine is terrible! One day after delivery we started having problems! The matching was shaking uncontrollably and making loud screeching noises. After multiple service calls and being told the machine is just loud we finally had someone agree that the machine was broken. It took about 3 weeks in order to get lowes to replace the machine. For about a week, the new machine seemed to be fine. Now, the uncontrollable shaking and screeching is back. Also, during one load, the machine started leaking water. I don't know what to do at this point. This is an absolute piece of junk machine. Don't waste your money!!"
2.0,"""Big Mistake!!!!""","This washer has been replaced twice and neither one worked properly, both washer lasted less then a year. They replaced nearly every part on the washer they could until for the second time they refunded our money for the purchase price of the washer.  Always buy extended warranties they don't make things like they use to."
2.0,"""Interior glass cracked""","After using the washer for less than three months we noticed a crack emerging from underneath the plastic insert.  We contacted Samsung immediately.  They are refusing to fix stating it is physical damage and not covered under warranty.  The problem being, moisture is building up on the inside of the glass which we are unable to get too and the crack continues to spread.  Given there is no bulls-eye indicating impact during use, it was likely damaged during assembly at the factory and/or related to the stress created in the glass as it was being shaped/cooled.  This is an expensive machine and should not be experiencing these types of issues without resolution from the company."
1.0,"""Broken after only 7 months of use""","Purchased the washer the beginning of July and waited until the very end of August for delivery after the first 2 came in damaged. After only 7 months it is not working error code 4C. So far 2 companies and 6 appliance repair visits it is still broken. I am now nearing 2 months without a washing machine and it is 3 ring circus between the repair companies, Lowes and Samsung. Works great as an expensive paper weight!"
5.0,"""GREAT WASHER & DRYER""","I purchased the set on August 18 ,20016 , it was delivered on September 18 .I absolutely love it but I hate the way the knob is starting to tarnish ."
4.0,"""great washer""",We have had this washer and matching dryer for a few months now.  We swapped from a top loader to this one.  We have been using powder detergent (Just using it till we run out) and has been working fine.  The instructions are easy to use and everything hooked up easily.  There are a lot of settings to clean and the sound is loud enough to hear from anywhere in the house.
3.0,"""Love the size""",When they installed the water hose was broken and had to replace the washer. Every so often I get error messages. But I love that I can get 2 loads into one and the clothes are very clean
5.0,"""Best washer and dryer (gas) set I have ever owned""","I bought the washer with the gas dryer over the July 4th holiday 2016 and they are amazing . Not sure why there are a couple of reviews stating that this washer is the worst . I guess everyone needs and wants something to complain about because I have had no issues and going on eight weeks and no problems and unlike anything you buy you are going to have a lemon in the bunch but that does not make it a bad washer , I could see if everyone who bought this washer complained , then I would've believed them but they have not ."

1.0,"""Lowe's should pull every Samsung washer""","I purchased a Samsung washer 2.5 years ago that is now recalled.  I bought from Lowe's and purchased the extended warranty.  Now samsung is offering a whooping $241 towards a new product and Lowe's is willing to ""prorate"" my extended warranty.  These are the worst washers and after reading some of these reviews wouldn't be surprised if the front loaders are recalled next.  if they, know that Lowe's won't do anything to help you."
3.0,"""Does not come with WiFi dongle""",Nowhere does it tell you that you must buy these separately until after you get the machines and find they are not included.  It would be nice if it was mentioned on the website.
5.0,"""Amazing features!!""","I recently purchased this model when my other samsung washer was recalled, plus it has the steam cleaning option and my other washer did not. The most important thing about this model (all samsung washers) is that the machine has to beleveled perfectly or else the machine will throw itself out of balance and move across the floor during the spin cycle, even if it's just a little bit out of level. Once you spend about 45 minutes to an hour leveling the machine, it works great. The steam cleaning option does do a great job. The washer also is ""Smart Home"" compatible butI haven't figured out why anybody would want an app for their clothes washer on their phone, I mean it's hard enough for me to remember or find the time to do laundry while I'm at home, what do you think the chances are of someone whipping out their phone while they're at work or wherever and checking the status of the washer's spin cycle, please, get real."
4.0,"""very good design!!""",I like the design and feature and easy to use. Also the interactive feature is what I like it

5.0,"""Options for the whole family!""","I love that the washer has options for active wear, linens, and steam. The add wash door is also super useful. Runs quiet. Nothing to complain about!"
5.0,"""New Washer""",I just received my new Washer and I love it great product
5.0,"""Front Loading Washer""",Best washer I've ever had. I'd recommend this item.
5.0,"""This Samsung frontload addwash washer undoubtedly is the best I've ever owned""",This Washer is great it does just about everything except talk to you although I haven't had the chance to read the owners manual maybe I should and I will I always do for new products I purchase its a mandatory thing you just have to do to ensure you're using your product properly but lets get back to the digitally controlled Samsung WF6500 washing machine. The digital controls makes this machine so easy to operate I couldn't resist I washed two loads as soon as the machine was installed and operational its great its able to wash larger loads than the machine it replaced which is only two years old and still works but can't touch this machine I washed a queen size comforter with no problem I definitely couldn't do that with my old top load agitator This is great this undoubtedly is the best machine I've ever owned and at age 68 to be 69 next month believe me I've owned quite a few I was always hesitant to purchase a front load washer I used to hear so many bad things about them. But the science on this machine is so advanced my clothes came out super clean I love it I would recommend this machine Its one of the best if not the best machines on the market clean super clean I mean really clean cloths and after the final spin by the washer the dryer didn't have to work as hard as it did with my old washer I could go on and on but I think more than likely you get the picture what a great product.
4.0,"""Love this washer ? Start of spin cycle noise.""",I love this washer. Just wonder why it makes a loud sound when it starts the spin cycle?

5.0,"""Samsung washer""",Love my new washer runs quiet uses very little water clean clothes extremely well love the new colors holds a lot of clothes I would highly recommend this washers valuable asset to any family
5.0,"""Excellent washer""","I like the washer and seems to perform very well. The only thing I didn't like or maybe it's just me. When I select towels and want to put it at a higher temperature it won't let me, so I have to choice another setting. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong or maybe I just can't do this. Another thing when I went to do the self clean it took 3 hours to perform. I'm not sure if it uses a lot of water or why it takes so long. I like the feature, but I don't know if I want to do that very often if it takes that long or uses a lot of water. If someone knows please let me know. So far I really like it and does an excellent job. Maybe I just need to get use to it."
4.0,"""Love the new feature to add laundry""",I appreciate the layout of the types of cycles offered and the late add of clothes during the load.

5.0,"""Love the washer""","Replaced the old washer my house came with, and i couldn't be happier. Gets clothes clean, works great with Pods. The add detergent drawer is hard to pour bleach into without mixing it with the fabric softener though, that is the one down side and there was really no reason for it to be so tight in there."
5.0,"""Initially impressed""","Just installed new washer so very limited use so far. Initial impressions are very good. Very intuitive controls, quiet operation and shorter cycle than my old washer."
5.0,"""Best Washer on the Market""","I love this washer, everything I could ever imagine wanting in a washer, every option imaginable, works perfectly."
5.0,"""Easy setup, 2nd time with Samsung""","Our previous model was similar, but 7 years old. Unfortunately the part that gave out it was more cost effective to replace than repair. We were also fortunate that although Samsung has changed the mounting brackets for their newer pedestals, ours existing pedestal still worked with the newer washer. Has the capability to be used through a smartphone but still waiting for the USB stick to arrive. Transition to the newer washer was very easy staying with Samsung. So far all is well"
5.0,"""The Beast of a Washer""",I am very pleased with my Samsung front loader. It gets clothes really clean while being ECO friendly. The black stainless steel is a great look!

This set is absolutely amazing.  The steam wash cycle gets baseball dirt out of my sons uniform!!  The little door is very useful.  I always find stray socks or washcloths that need to be added to the cycle.  The self cleaning mode is awesome!  I am glad I do not have to remember to do this as the machine flashes the cleaning symbol at the end of the 40th cycle.  The only down side is that it does take almost 4 hours for the washer to complete the self cleaning."

Sure enough, after a couple washes through this new Samsung front loader, my clothes are coming out brighter. One other change I made was reducing the amount of soap I was using per load, I only use now between 1 and 2 Tablespoons, depending on how dirty my clothes are. Now I get to save money, and get cleaner clothes!"

4.0,"""Add a Wash Samsung Washer Usage First Month""","Washer seems to do a fine job. We would wish that there was also a separate spin cycle without the rinse portion. In this way, we could add a wet item that would not need the time and energy associated with a rinse component to it. Also, for start up of spin cycle, there is a moderate vibration which is transient. Not sure what the cause of it is. The washer is verfied to be level and stable as it sits. All in all, a good machine and welcome upgrade replacement to our old washer."

It lets you know when it's done with a relaxed tune or, if you purchase the optional ""home link"" for the small door on the top, on your smartphone.

5.0,"""This washer is great!""","I've only had my washer for 2 weeks and I have been very impressed with it. It washes better than my last washer and seems to be gentler on my clothes. The only thing I could ask for improvement is that the sound level be adjustable. If I'm watching TV, I cannot hear the chime when the cycle is finished."

5.0,"""Great Washer""","I purchased this machine a couple months ago to replace a smaller front loader that I didn't feel was getting my clothes as clean as it should. Sure enough, after a couple washes through this new Samsung front loader, my clothes are coming out brighter. One other change I made was reducing the amount of soap I was using per load, I only use now between 1 and 2 Tablespoons, depending on how dirty my clothes are. Now I get to save money, and get cleaner clothes!"
5.0,"""Love this washer""","Only had for three days now, but I love this washer. I will be leaving both main and add door open at all times when not in use. Only complaint is as much as this washer cost, and the fact that it is a high maintenance washer, they could throw in the adapter for cell phone use. Sold separately!"

4.0,"""Great washer, lousy website""","One would expect an information technology company like Samsung to have decent websites. But alas, I had to spend more than 20 minutes trying to get out of their ""Product Registration"" website infinite do-loops just to register my washer. Memo to Samsung: your exploding-drum-washing-machine reputation is NOT served by your horrible website design and repeated ""login"" screens that don't get your customer to where they think they're going.

Two times I have used it (with small loads), it has flooded my laundry room. I had a technician out that said the drain pump was slow. This is on top of the brand new dryer I purchased to go along with the washer that is not working at all right now due to broken belt.

5.0,"""Great investment!""","After extensive research, I decided to purchase this Samsung washer, and it's one of my best decisions ever! My children are athletes, so we take this machine to task on an every other day basis - and it cleans the clothes very well, removing the sweat ""aroma"" and stains. The steam clean feature does excellent on linens, and all of our laundry is clean and fresh. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone looking for a reliable machine with great results at a decent price. The ""add wash"" door is also a neat and convenient addition for last minute forgotten items. My only regret is not purchasing the pedestal!"

There are so many options to choose from and they all work well! I love the unique add wash feature because I always forget something and it's large enough to fit anything through. I am so happy with it as well as the matching Dryer that I enjoy doing laundry.Both the Washer and Dryer have Steam functions which work great as well. Both are quiet too.Best purchase I ever made on an appliance!
5.0,"""Great Addwash feature""","I had no idea that I needed the addwash feature in my life. It adds a alot of convenience factor as with the conventional front loaders once you get the cycle going, you're stuck with it until the end. I'm glad we decided on this washer. And the spin cycle, considering how fast it spins, is fairly quiet. I've been using the ""towel cycle"" often as well because it really does get my towels cleaner and fluffier."

We purchased the updated version without looking at any other brands. Love this product, the efficiency , the whiteness of my clothes, and the way the stains are removed. Sure the detergent has something to do with it but I know Samsung is in charge!"
5.0,"""VERY PLEASED""",We are very happy with this washer. It runs very quiet and doesn't get out of balance like our top load washers did. We decided to get Samsung because our daughter has had very good results with her Samsung washers. She gave her 10 year old Samsung away to a family member that is still using it and it still works great and runs quiet. Our daughter purchased a different Samsung washer and is equally pleased with it. After 2 leading brand washers that were topload didn't last a total of 5 years combined we decided to give Samsung a chance and so far we are glad we did. We did purchases the extended warranty just incase we do have problems. The customer service has been very impressive for my daugher also and if she needed repairs the Samsung repairman came the same week and had the parts available so she has had no problems with repair or customer service either.

4.0,"""Overall good machine""","Overall, so far, I am happy with the machine. It's only been 3 days. But the drum is lower than my old machine. I practically have to get on my knees to get the clothes out. There isn't any explanation for what the symbols/icons mean on the machine."
5.0,"""Amazing Washer""","We spent weeks looking at all sorts of washers not really knowing anything about features, front loaders VS top loaders, efficiency or style. We had our minds set on an LG brand washer and dryer until we decided to go to one more place and see what they had to offer. Not only did the store price the appliance so well but the style, features, and efficiency of this washer put us so far over on our choice to buy, I would highly recommend it to anyone else. It's quiet, has various cycles for different clothes, stains, load amounts and more and it's sleek. We especially love the ""add door"" feature because we constantly forget to add clothes or find a dropped item of clothing and this is a great added bonus on top of everything else. Thank you Samsung for designing a washer we will use for years to come! As an added comment, we especially love the feature to add warranty. Not many manufacturers allow longer warranties and allow you to extend them once the time is coming to a close."

4.0,"""Love it!""","So far, I love this washer. Wish I could have given it 5 stars, but it has 2 things that I felt it needed or failed in. First, I wish it had a light to signal that the load was done. My old washer had one and I found it almost a necessity. I would occasionally forget that I had laundry in the washer and the light reminded me to get it out! Second, I purchased the Smart Home Adapter, for my washer and spent a great deal of time trying to connect it to the App. As of this date, I have not been able to get it to work. I looked at the app reviews and it seems that pretty much no one has been able to master it! Samsung offers a very innovative feature but it seems they didn't deliver. It's not really important to me to run my washer with my phone, however, I think that being able to diagnose a problem would be very beneficial. I still love the washer and hope that the App eventually gets updated to be much more user friendly!!"
5.0,"""GREAT PRODUCT""",I have only had my machine for a couple weeks but so far love it!I had a machine that was in the recall list and replaced it with another Samsung only got a front loader this time. the only reason I didn't give it 5 * on all is because I haven't had it long enough too rate features and design any higher at this time.So far love it

4.0,"""Rock Solid""",This is my second Samsung front load washer with a direct drive system. First finally gave out after 10 years. My experience with the first machine led me to buy another. Excellent performance from a solid machine. The VRT is absolutely excellent and hardly notice when the machine is in spin cycle. Pretty impressive since the laundry room is on the second floor. Highly recommended.
5.0,"""Tons of great features""",The ability to add clothes during the washing process is a great addition to many features they have.
5.0,"""I love the features of my new Samsung washer""","I'm a previous Samsung washer owner and I love the new features. The add wash feature lets me add additional items to the wash that I missed adding at the start of the wash. I'm very impressed with the display panel because it is easy to use and it is loaded with options. The look and design of the washer is beautiful, sleek, more energy efficient, and much quieter to use. The best washer I have owned by far."
5.0,"""VERY USER FRIENDLY!!!!!!!!!""","I really enjoy this machine!!!! The display with easy to use, with the large capacity, and add wash which makes this unit really, really EXCELLENT!!! I even like how I am able to use either preset options or mix & match with the numerous combinations to dry my clothes. Plus, when you add the Smart Home Adapter and use the app, it only makes not having to go to the machine until it is finished......This is what I am talking about since, my machines are in our basement and that will really help with not running up and down the several flights of stairs!!!! GO SAMSUNG!!!!!"
5.0,"""GREAT SAMSUNG WASHER!""","This washer is EXCELLENT! It is quiet, leaves no residue on the clothing, holds a HUGE load and has many settings, including sterilizing cycles that use extra hot water. Our previous front-loading washer was a different brand and had multiple problems, including mold that grew around the door gasket and residue left on the clothing, which needed to be rinsed out prior to drying the clothes."
5.0,"""Samsung Washer""","Superb piece of engineering, effortless operations."
4.0,"""Good so far, useless extra door""","I have had it for less than a year, but I do like it. The only thing I didn't realize before buying though was that you have to wait for the washer to stop before you can open the door, so it's just as easy to just throw it in the big door. The extra door feature hasn't made it that much easier. Also, even though I leave the door open after every wash, mold collects in the extra door for some reason."

You can not see the into the wash drum when the door is closed & it is very dark inside the drum even when the door is open. You may need to turn on more light in your laundry room to be able to get a good view inside. I do like all of the special features."

4.0,"""I like what I see so far""","The setup process wasn't too bad. The washer is HEAVY! need help to move it around for sure. I like all the features and such. I dont love the buttons on the front. they seem pretty unresponsive and could prove to fail over time. I could be wrong about that, but I would prefer traditional buttons instead of the sensors. But they work, so not really an issue. Clothes come out almost dry when its done, which is great because that will save power for the dryer. Overall I am happy. Time will tell if this was a great decision."

5.0,"""So Far, So Good""","Our washing machine repair guy recommended the front loading Samsung. He said, ""Ignore all the drama with their top loaders- the front loaders are great."" So we listened. So far, so good. We have had the washer about a week and have had no issues with it, as expected. The true test will come with the passing of time. It's louder than I expected, but it doesn't make me dislike it. I love how clean everything is and the effectiveness of the spin cycle. I had thought my dryer was dying, but it turned out that my old machine simply wasn't spinning the clothes out effectively."
5.0,"""Love love love this washer""","Cleans way better than my old washer and I can see the electricity savings, steam is fantastic too."
5.0,"""A complete washer""",This product is amazing. A lot of thought went into the programming of this washer. I have run many of the cycles that are available to the user. This machine is very quiet and has much less vibration than any other washer we have owned.
4.0,"""Very Good""",My family and I like this washer machine. Only down fall is the drain hose is pretty sure and we had to purchase and install a longer one for our set up. other than that awesome.
5.0,"""This product has great functionality and currency""","This product brings us into the current age of functionality, performance, and versatility. After having the same washer for over 20 years, I was not aware of how much progress had been made during that time. After the first use, I was completely sold!"
5.0,"""Great features and user friendly""","No one really likes doing laundry, but I literally go around the house to find something to wash. Really happy with our purchases."
5.0,"""Great Features""","Since I put the samsung washer and dryer ,I do not have to go to the cleaners ."
4.0,"""Special and Innovative""",Love that this has the ability to add clothes without powering off. Smart and elegant is how I would describe it.
5.0,"""This product has great performance but would like to use Add Door during more cycles""",I love this washer! I only wish that I could use the Add Door more often. You can only use the door during certain times (when the icon is flashing) with a couple of cycles.
5.0,"""So many features!""","Washer has so many features! Impressive, cleans clothes remarkably well. A+"
5.0,"""Awesome Product""",This washing machine is awesome. It does everything as advertised what a releif to purchase a product with no worries.
5.0,"""Nice Front load washer""",Seems to be a great washer and first load was easy to learn and fast.
5.0,"""Wow....what a great washer!""","Compared to our 10 year old Kenmore Elite washer, there is no comparison. The Samsung washing machine is fantastic. Laundry now comes out clean, not damaged from the old top load with agitator. Quiet, absolute quiet, no longer having to close the laundry room door. Love the preset options and the app for maintenance and helpful information. Even if your not tech savvy you'll get it....so easy to use. Samsung has done a beautiful job on the design. This washer is sleek, stylish and an eye catcher. The blue ocean colored door is a great accent. I love the additional door to use in adding laundry which is great for us busy moms and career women. With 6 of us using the washer, energy star ratings a was a key factor in selecting a new washer. I cannot wait to see the saving in my electric bill. Some States/counties offer rebates so check with them if your's offers one."
5.0,"""Great washer to move to from top loader""","I have been contemplating moving to a front load washer for years. With the new door that allows clothes to be added after a cycle has started, I had to do it. So far I love this product. It is much more efficient than my previous washer, and is very quiet and stable."
5.0,"""Great features""",Has great features but can't find what the icons are
4.0,"""Add Wash Feature""","The best feature of the washer is the add wash window. This allows you to add items that are forgotten once the cycle has started without opening the door. The washer has a large capacity and the drum turns automatically as you remove the clothes. If any clothes are stuck on the drum, the weight of the clothes causeit to rotate."
5.0,"""Excellent washing machine""",I had a top looder before l wasn't satisfied it didn't wash very clean I have to wash repeatedly
5.0,"""Great Washer""",Just got this washer. Washed 4 loads and every thing worked well. The washer did exactly what we expected.
5.0,"""I LIKE THIS PRODUCT""",YOU MAKE THIS REVIEW MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT HAS TO BE. I SIMPLY LIKE THE PRODUCT WHEN I SAW IT AND I EXPECT GOOD SATISFACTION AS HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH OTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCTS I HAVE PURCHASED IN THE PAST AND STILL OWN
5.0,"""Love it""",Love all the different features the washer has. The mini window to open during wash is great. The super speed wash and steam love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
5.0,"""Way much better than the top loader""","Faster than the one i have before, very nice looking, got a better price for it"
5.0,"""Great washer for my needs""","I wanted a large washer that could handle washing my large down comforters, and this does the trick. This washer is big enough to handle 7 pairs of jeans, with plenty of additional space to be tumbled around during the cycle. There are plenty of wash cycles to choose from, depending on your laundering needs (I typically use the normal, whites, or bedding settings), and the add-wash door is convenient for the moments I find stray clothes that belong on that wash. Cuts my laundry days so much shorter than before I bought this washer, and I love it."
5.0,"""Wonderful new model""","Just received, installed and tried our new appliances. Was easy to install and get going.Initial results are very positive and looking forward to years of great loads.Thanks"
5.0,"""Does everything you need and more""","Install was pretty straight forward, but getting the washer on the pedestal took some thought and effort. I ended up putting two short 2 x 4s on top of the pedestal so we could lift the washer onto the 2 x 4s without smashing our fingers. We then rocked the machine to one side, engaged the mounts, and pulled out one of the 2 x 4s, then the opposite for the other. As heavy as this machine is, I don't see any way one person could do this safely without specialized equipment to lift the washer. I'm sure the delivery teams have something. After the install, the first issue was a squeaking noise on spin up. A quick Google search showed how to put the drum in calibration mode, and I ran the calibration (press and hold Delay Start and Temp for three seconds, C6 appears on screen, press start). Squeaking stopped. We have used the small door to add clothes. Very convenient. We did not have to change our laundry soap - we were using All pods, and they are also recommended for HE washers. The range of settings is a bit daunting at first, but it doesn't take long to figure them out. The only one I can't understand is why the Heavy Duty cycle defaults to hot water. I never wash in hot water alone, and most laundry soaps are designed to work at cold water temperatures. It's not 1960 anymore. This unit replaced a 22 year old Kenmore (Whirlpool) top loader that served me well. I am already seeing a difference in energy consumption. This thing is really frugal. I could not be happier."
5.0,"""Love my Washer""","I just purchased this washer a week ago. I saved towels, whites, delicates to wash and try it out. It is much quieter than my old agitator machine. My white clothes came out bright white (I was impressed, I don't use bleach and just used my normal Tide pod). My delicates came out perfect as well as the towels!I am so glad I purchased this machine. I gave the design 4 stars only because they add in door the opening is rather small and really useless! You have to pause the machine to add anything might as well open the door!"
5.0,"""Best Front Loader I have ever owned""",So happy with the new washing machine and dryer. The price was right and I am so glad we upgraded. Just remember when setting up the appliances remember to read the manual and do the set up of both machines to avoid problems later. Both machines are easy to use. Could not be happier.
5.0,"""Great Washer""",Love using this washer very user friendly and works very well
2.0,"""Noisy, High Maintenance""","Contrary to what Samsung says, the machine is not quiet, vibrates, and squeaks during the wash cycle. Also, the unit is not maintenance free, as the wire mesh filters in the water intake lines must be removed and cleaned out once a year, and the filter (inconveniently located at the lower left hand front corner of the unit) must also be cleaned out every two months. Had I known the machine would be such high maintenance, I would have chosen another brand of washer other than Samsung."
4.0,"""Great washer""","This washer is amazing, easy set up, very quiet, steam option. well worth the money."
5.0,"""Great product for the price""",I just got my washer and dryer installed but it feels like Christmas! So far so good and the add in clothes feature is pretty neat.
5.0,"""great product""",I've had Samsung products in the past and am really enjoying this front load machine. It's so quiet and efficient. And is very energy efficient also. Love it!
5.0,"""Phenomenal Machine!""",My review will be more complete after the family takes the time to learn how to obtain the best results out of this new work horse. Beautiful design -I'm very glad to have the pedestal option added to my selection. After doing a couple of first washes I know this machine is very efficient at doing good work with less water.
5.0,"""Great features""",The quick wash feature greatly reduces wash time. The added bonus washing with this model is that it also will reduced the drying time. I just had it for a week so can't comment on durability.
5.0,"""Great product great company great value""","This washer is loaded with awesome features from add wash to the Bluetooth troubleshooting to smart home so the user is able to control it with their smartphone at or away from home ,doing laundry has never been more enjoyable or easier and has a very appealing design it is also extremely quiet , ive been buying Samsung products for years and am very pleased ,they're always coming out with new innovative technology to make life easier and more enjoyable thanks Samsung for delivering another great product,cant wait to buy my matching dryer and hopefully a refrigerator and microwave"
5.0,"""COOL FEATURES AND RUNS GREAT""",So far it is performing very well. I think it is going to be a good asset with other products I already own from Samsung!!
5.0,"""wonderful washer !""","Love this washing machine. So many great features, quiet, performance is super !"
4.0,"""Add cloth feature is very useful""","Easy to load and add cloth. noise and vibration is adorable. however, there should be an important notice to remove the shipping bolts which led an hugh vibration for my first use, even it points out on the paper of the manual or start up. the other idea should be some warning or error code to indicate user that the shipping bolts were not removed in case that the user didn't go through the startup paper.again, the washer is the heaviest of what I used. It took me a lot of muscle to shift it and remove the shipping bolts."
4.0,"""Favorite washer""","I have live in many states and many apartments/condos. I have dealt with my fair share of good, bad, and terrible washers. This is by far the best we have ever ha. There are so many features that never existed on our previous washers and it makes doing laundry that much easier! Definitely not going to complain about this product!"
5.0,"""This product is the best washer I have ever had. love it.""","Best features, the best design, super happy with it. The money are worth it."
5.0,"""Excellent Value""",I am very pleased with this product. It is the fifth Samsung product I have purchased and I have been very happy with all of them. I would highly recommend this washer.
4.0,"""Samsung Washer""","Works great, has an easy interface, and had great energy efficiency."
5.0,"""When Did A Washer become Eye Candy""","This is our second Samsung front-load washer, and it doesn't disappoint. Works perfectly. Installation was easy. Looks incredible."
1.0,"""Vibration and noise from the drum""","I received this product today.Teste spin cycle and it vibrates without load.Also, there is noise from the drum as if there are some coins inside."
5.0,"""Very Quiet""","I purchased this washer after careful consideration of other brands and models. Another model that I had my eye on was going to be out of stock for some time so I decided to go with this model. The steam feature and the Add A Wash are two features that I intend to try when needed. I do not care for the jingle that plays at the end of the cycle so I have muted it. Samsung should install a nice, soft buzzer instead of an annoying little song."
5.0,"""Great machine !!!""",Very quiet & useful features for any kind of cloth. It worth every penny you'll spend on it.So far it's the machine in my life !!!

5.0,"""Silent and Fast""",Washer that is so silent that you wonder if its running . wonderful machine ..many cycles to choose from.
2.0,"""2 repairs in 2 months.....""","This machine seemed great for the first 2 weeks. Quiet, washed well, and easy to operate. Unfortunately the door started leaking and needed replaced and now the machine rattles and makes a loud squeaking noise. The machine is only 2 months old. Awaiting another repair. Questioning the quality of this product. Samsung customer service has been excellent so far thankfully. Would recommend buying store service program if you purchase this item. I've been led to believe the door leaking issue is not uncommon. Machine also does not have spin only cycle which is a bummer."

5.0,"""SAMSUNG WASHING MACHINE""","After having a front loading washing machine that was on its last leg and was purchased over 10 years ago. My new Samsung is a welcomed new addition to the household. With it larger capacity drum and multi tiered operating system, this machine does it all. It is quiet, efficient, and really easy to use.  Couple of recommendations: 1. Be sure to measure the space that you are placing this, as it is larger than the standard washing machine (also, if you plan on stacking, be sure to measure the height of the space). 2. Read the manuals to fully understand the functionality of this machine. Although, I have only had this washer for a few weeks, I am very pleased with everything thus far!"
5.0,"""This product has great features""",I love the fact that I can add clothes once the washer begins. Even though I've been washing clothes all my life. I some how still forget something.
