4.0,"""So far so good, HOWEVER........""","Why so many problems with this washer later on in years?  Look at this site:  https://www.google.com/search?q=spider+problems+with+Samsung+washers&ie;=utf-8&oe;=utf-8It deals with the Spider bracket the holds the drum, the metal corrodes due to incompatible metals joined together. So will this washer only last maybe 5 years until drum starts shaking?"
5.0,"""Great machine and adapters are now available""","Purchased this and the matching dryer during Memorial day sale. Lowes delivery was great and they installed it on our custom pedestal with care for the walls etc. The machine works great and handles all the laundry my family of 5 can throw at it. The wifi adapters weren't available on the samsung site at the time (not even listed). About 2 weeks later they were listed and I ordered them, but they were out of stock and on backorder. They came into stock the last week of June and were here via fedex in a couple of days. Easy setup for those with our home router. The positive controls of the machines is a neat feature, but we really love getting the alerts when the cycles are done on our phones in case you are out of range of the chime. The clothes are cleaner than our other washer/dryer set, they dry faster, and the machines are quieter. Even with high speed spin, you might hear it spinning, but ZERO vibration through the machines/floor/walls/etc which is important because ours is on the second floor near bedrooms. I did make sure to purchase new stainless hoses with flow controls (had them in the past and they are worth it) and bought the protection plan (one pump or LED screen and it will pay off quick)."
3.0,"""Good idea. Good concept. Poor quality""",I purchased this washer and dryer set and had it delivered on may 17th 2016. The product arrived just fine. Within the first 5hrs of using it I noticed that 2 of the led lights to for the modes were not working on the dryer. I called Samsung and they stated that it's cosmetic and does not affect functionality therefor if I wanted it fixed it would be up to Lowe's or out of my own pocket.  Second off it states there is an available wifi module to connect the set up to wifi and control or monitor remotely. This is the feature that swayed me from lg as I have a lot of nice clothes and if for some reason I was out a little longer than expected I would love the option to turn on the wrinkle free setting remotely so I don't have to fight and iron extremely wrinkled clothes later or run them thru a steam cycle. I iron daily bit if you have ever tried to iron severely wrinkled clothes you know how much of a pain that is. Well samsung had no clue to what this adapter was. Said both my new washer and dryer was broke and wanted to send someone to fix it. After several phone calls and multiple supervisors I was finally informed that this is not released yet and should be out by the end of the year. Pretty messed up as all documentation says it's available now.  On a positive note the washer and dryer work great at cleaning and drying clothes. I have never had or used a washer and dryer that performed so well. If Samsung could get their act together and know/support their products this would have easily been rated 5 stars in all categories. Had it not been for the above issues I would recommend these to anyone and everyone. If I ever have to buy anothwr washer and dryer I will seriously be giving LG a good long look and probably going with LG in the future. If your u can deal with the potential issues and have no worries about maybe eventually getting the wifi adapters then I would highly recommend these as they clean and dry clothing on a whole new level.
3.0,"""Washes well until filter clogs""","Long story short: Washes well but pump/debris filter needs to be cleaned (human/pet hair) every 2-3 weeks, much more often than Samsung advises! Even if you manually drain residual water from machine, about a QUART gushes out when filter is opened. Unacceptable to me and probably most others but Samsung claims this is ""normal?"" Good luck...!"
4.0,"""Beautiful machine with vibration issue""","I received my beautiful new washing machine on December 2nd 2016 and the first load of wash shook the machine so hard that the corner piece of the pedestal shook off of the machine.  This was not a huge load, but did include two pairs of jeans, two towels and socks and underwear.  I will adjust my rating later if I see an improvement."
2.0,"""new waher dosen't workin""",I bought this washer 4 days ago new last night I calibrated and I stard washing it dosen't finish the cycle and sounds like a train and it moves so bad that scratched my new paint. They are going to replace it but lets see how it goes 9/14/16
1.0,"""HORRIBLE customer service""","Received this matched set couple of days before Thanksgiving, 2016.The installers failed to properly setup washer. The interior light didn't work. Had issues with the washer being balanced. Didn't know until the installers had left. While they were here I pointed out that it wasn't balanced and they adjusted it a little bit. Lo and behold, first load squeaked loudly.To top this off, I contacted Samsung and their service repair a specialist would contact me within 24-48 hours.Six 6 Days later I call back to find out my ticket was cancelled! The manager told me don't know why. This is my first experience with Samsung and probably my last! I will NOT recommend Samsung appliances to any friends. Maybe an enemy.lol"
5.0,"""Great Steam Washer""","Love the Steam cycle, it just makes your clothes clean fresh and crisp"
5.0,"""easy to use and it is very quite""",Wash fast the clothes come out clean and smelling good.
5.0,"""Awesome washer""",Love this washer. Cleans great. Looks nice. Plenty of options to choose from.
5.0,"""Outstanding and looks amazing!!""",This washer is just stunning and works amazing!! It is very roomy and runs smooth and quite.. the add wash door comes in handy when needed and looks good to. The LED light in the washer is a great feature as well. We bought this washer because we are having a baby and wanted the sanitize mode. I find this washer out performs my expectations!! And it's a great size to.. ( very roomy ) Thank You Samsung for another great product!!  *Ed G*
5.0,"""So many options!""",I absolutely love this machine! It can wash an oversized king comforter and actually wring it completely out! I would highly suggest this washer.
5.0,"""Super Speed- Cycle""","Complete, thorough wash cycle in 30 minutes! A must have feature for on the go families!"
5.0,"""Great Steam Washer""","Love the Steam cycle, it just makes your clothes clean fresh and crisp"
5.0,"""Great Washer""","This washer is amazing. Much better than the top loader. It is faster, quieter, and gets the clothes cleaner. I highly recommend."
4.0,"""We are very pleased with all the features,""","We would recommend to family, friends and relatives."
5.0,"""This is the best washer we have had!""",We have only had this washer for a couple weeks but it is doing a GREAT job! It is easy to use. It came on a pedal stool so it is at a perfect height for all of our family members to use.I love the fact it is more energy efficient and uses less water than our last washer. It is very quiet.Overall I am very glad we selected this machine.It is very heavy so don't plan to move it once you get it in place.
4.0,"""Still would prefer dials instead of computer""",Very good overall product. They size is a little to large for the area we had to put it in. It is very hard getting used to the front load when you are used to a top load but I like the front load feature because the top loaders today are too deep for people that are under 5 foot tall.
5.0,"""Great Washer""",I was so excited of receiving this washer. I was so impressed about all the features it has and especially it's capacity I would really recommend it
5.0,"""My New Washer""",I love my new washer! The design and options are fantastic. I am going to enjoy using the my new Samsung Washer.
5.0,"""Happy with new washer""","I've had front loaders from other companies, but the size and quiet operation has this washer heads above. I currently have a mixed set (old washer was recalled) but this size of this washer is close to that of my dryer. I love the color and the washer seems really solid in its construction."
5.0,"""Great Energy Edficient Washer""","Purchased the Samsung 5.0 Washer after much research and learning it not only had the largest capacity in its class, but great and desirable features like add wash so you can add things you forget to a load like a top loading washer, steam wash, and of course super energy and water efficiency. I'd highly recommend this washer to anyone."
5.0,"""Great washer""",I've been using a stackable for years and decided to get a newer model. I'd heard front loaders are the best at getting your wash clean and am not disappointed. Comforters that always came out not so clean are almost like new again! I LOVE this washer!
3.0,"""Control Panel does not respond to my touch and Drum light does not turn on when you open the door after a wash.""","I like the washer for the most part. The only thing that bothers me (and unfortunately it appears that it will continue to bother me for the life of this machine) is that the control panel does not respond to my touch. It does respond to other people's touch, but just not mine. The Samsung came and looked at it and replaced the control panel. Even he was puzzled why the control panel does not respond to my touch. I tried wetting and warming my hands with hot water, and it still does not sense my touch. I tried touching it with a piece of metal, and it still does not sense my touch. So whenever I need to change the setting of the washer, I have to find someone else to change it for me. I was reading some reviews, and apparently I am not the only one who has this problem. Samsung needs to provide a solution for people like me. Otherwise all these features and options mean nothing to people like me.Another feature that does not work well is after a wash is completed, when I open the door, the drum light does not turn on. The light does turn on when I first open the door to put clothes in. But the light is more needed after the wash is completed than before I put in any clothe. I really don't need the light when I put my clothes in. I do need the light when the wash is completed to find spinned clothing pieces that might get stuck somewhere. So it is stupid that the drum light does not turning on when you open the door after a wash is completed."
4.0,"""Great features""",We love the variety of available settings. The only negative so far is that water drops off the door when it is opened.
3.0,"""good but...""","I bought the matching dryer and I have to stack the units. These are very tall when stacked and I am 5'6"" and less and I would have to use a step stool. I do not have the pedestal under them. When the washer is done there seems to be alot of residual water left, I am concerned about this and will be watching carefully for the next couple of loads."
5.0,"""Excellent !!""",Excellent and love it. Great Features to select from.
5.0,"""Great Washer""",Cleans much better than my old Kenmore Elite front loader. spin cycle works much better on getting water out of clothing requiring less drying time. clothes smell cleaner. I just Cleaned my hunting clothes which were smoked from 5 days in a tent with word burning stove. Came out fresh and new.
3.0,"""FRONT LOADERS SEEM THE SAME""","I love the look of the washer but on three separate occasions, half loads were did not drain well. I checked the hoses, the door remained locked after unplugging the washer. My only solution was to use the Rise & Spin function to drain the excess water and unlock the washer."
5.0,"""Quiet and large capacity""","Love the large capacity of this washer. We are able to wash our king sized sheet set, 2 twin sheet sets, and a crib sheet all in one load! The washer is very quiet. It neighbors our family room, and we cannot hear it running while watching movies! This washer has simplified our laundry workload each week, highly recommend!"
5.0,"""Love it!""","This new Samsung washer is excellent. Upgraded from a decent front load. This unit has lots of features for different washing needs. Being a family of 5 with 3 kids, we go through a ton of clothes and this unit does a great job washing. Love this purchase."
4.0,"""Like the ease in using a front load washer.""",Like my new washer. Wish the light in the washer drum would come on automatically when I open the door . So many options I can use without fear of ruining my delicate fabrics.
5.0,"""So Far So Good!""","Just received and so far, love all the features and options! Looks good, and love having a flat top to fold laundry on!"
5.0,"""Greatest  Washer""",I purchased the machine over a month ago after returning my LG top of the line machine. What a difference in the wash and quietness of the machine. This machine works well and is quiet and I love the front shoot as I'm always forgetting something.
3.0,"""Washes great but not when filter clogs""","Long story short: Washes well but pump/debris filter needs to be cleaned (human/pet hair) every 2-3 weeks, much more often than Sumsung advises! Even if you manually drain residual water from machine, about a QUART gushes out when filter is opened. Unacceptable to me and probably most others but Samsung claims this is ""normal?"" Good luck...!"
5.0,"""Exceeded expectations""","We replaced a top load washer with this one. We were drawn to all the features. My wife couldn't stop bragging on this machine after the first day of use. She was amazed at how clean the towels came out after using the sanitize cycle. She continues to say how she loves how the clothes come out with less water retention after the spin cycle and therefore dry faster. Finally, she claims the clothes are less wrinkled with this machine. Yes it may cost more than some, but we believe it is definitely worth it."
5.0,"""Enjoying my new washer!""","So far so good, installed and operational. Seems to be doing a great job, loads better than the previous washer I owned. (pun intended)"
5.0,"""This model has great features.""",We had a Samsung washer before we got this one. We are very happy with all the features of this model.
5.0,"""Great Purchase""","So far this has been a great washer. The capacity is huge, it easily fit 9 pairs of jeans with no trouble and spun them adequately dry. The controls are easy to read and use and there are many choices of cycles. The normal cycle is fast - 45 minutes. It's super quite and has very little vibration (even with the 9 pairs of jeans during the spin cycle). Made my white T-shirts look like new. A little pricey but worth the price - just wait for a sale."
5.0,"""Exceptional Quality and Performance""",I purchased this washer recently and must say that I am very impressed with it so far. I had another washer for over 20 years and got very good service from it. I am hoping that this Samsung Washer can give me the same if not more long years of service as my original washer. I bought this Samsung Washer because of the company's very good brand name and its commitment to producing exceptional products. I am hoping that I am not disappointed. Thank you.

4.0,"""Love the addwash""","By the second load of laundry, we are already using the addwash door. It is a great feature for anyone with kids that leave clothes everywhere! The only con so far is that the buttons are not sensitive enough. While changing functions, it doesn't register my finger touch on the button or it is delayed, thus skipping over my selection as I have pressed the button 3 extra times by the time it catches up."
5.0,"""Excellent all-around features""","I am extremely happy with this washer. It has more than enough features for anything you would want to do, and I'm sure that it will be very depandable for years to come! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
5.0,"""Great looking""","This product Looks amazing, great size inside, love the new color."
5.0,"""So far I love this machine!""",This is a replacement for my older Samsung washer which went belly up. We bought another Samsung because we liked the other machine so much. So far (I have only had it for a couple of weeks) I couldn't be happier with this machine. Have done approximately 15 loads of laundry in it and it has cleaned so well and seems to be gentle on all of my laundry. I hope it holds up for many years. I will be writing another review if it doesn't. I am a happy Samsung customer.

5.0,"""Great Washer""","Went from a top load to a side load. Love the difference. Cleans great and very quiet. Bought the home adapter, which is nice because when load is finshed it notifies me, cuz I have a tendency to forget about it. I also recommend the pedestals, makes loading and unloading much easier."
5.0,"""LASG""",We just started using our new Samsung Washer. It is great andwe are very excited about the new technology
5.0,"""love the details""",love the details of very single option you have to wash and steam on your clothes
5.0,"""This washer is perfect in every catagory!""","I have had other washers and non of them compare with the Samsung front loader washer model WF50K7500AVA2. It washes my clothes very well, and has multiple settings for just the type of load. I am so happy I can wash my king size comforter at home. I like the nice little tone that it plays when it's done too! We have had it now for a couple of months I am expecting to have it for a long time."
5.0,"""LOVE my Samsung Washer and Dryer""","So easy to use. I was skeptical about going with the HE washer and dryer. Especially this one that has no agitator. But it has made a believer out of me. I heard horror stories about mold building up in the drum. The salesperson told us that as long as you follow the instructions in the owners manual and keep the door open between wash loads so it can dry out, nothing will happen. He pointed out that the military has used front loaders for years. Well, if its good enough for Uncle Sam, its good enough for me. I have cut down tremendously on the amount of detergent I use. Unbelievable the money saved in that alone."
4.0,"""washer""",I just received the washer 2 weeks ago. So far so good.
5.0,"""This product has great features with multi-purpose""",My wife enjoyed using this washier and it is a life saver. Excellent quality with electric efficiency as well as capacity to do the job.
5.0,"""So far we are pleased""",We have had this unit for over a month now and are very pleased with the washer overall. It replaced a Kenmore Elite that I purchased from regretfully from a Sears outlet (don't recommend) and the unit after 3 tries wasn't fixed. I did my research and settled on this unit. We are pleased with the features and functions along with its performance. It is quiet and so far has done a great job on everything from stains to larger items like blankets and sheets.
5.0,"""Quiet & Cleaning Power""","I've only had this washer for less than a week and have done 4 loads, but the quietness and cleaning power surpasses my previous front & top-loaders hands down!"
4.0,"""The design features are very attractive.""","Overall, I really do like this washer. The design is very impressive and eye-catching. I haven't tried them yet, but there are several nice features, such as, sanitizing, allergen and deep steam. It saves detergent products due to functioning with less water It functions well on the normal, delicate whites, etc. settings, I like that. However, when I tried to wash a small heavy rug, I placed it on heavy duty and extra high spin, but it just would not spin the water out, I had to line dry the rug, that did not make me a happy. It would be nice if it had an ""add extra water"" feature, and I think clear glass in the front would be better (maybe not as ""space age"" looking), but at least I would be able to see what my washer is doing at a glance; I miss those 2 features."
5.0,"""Sound""",For some reason the washer sound is off. Haven't figured out how to turn it back on.
5.0,"""I Love this Washer!!""","This product repalces a 15 year old other brand front-loading washer. The Samsung has so many wonderful features the old one didn't. I especially like the ability to adjust the time of various wash cycles as i believe some things should be washed for longer periods of time if very dirty, Also the add-a garmet feature as i am always finding 1 or 2 items that need to be added to a cycle already started.. We very much like the ease of use, very clear control panel, (& the fact that it 'sings' to me at the end of cycle, etc. all & all a very nice product to use & own."
5.0,"""AWESOME FRONT LOAD WASHER""",great product by Samsung using overall experience excellent five star
5.0,"""Awesome""","We receive our new washer today and we are amaze with the performance. We use to have 2 years old laundry center or all in one how I like to call it, with a top load washer, it perform well for us until recently that started licking, after calling the technician the repair was going to cost you just a 200 dollars less than a new washer. So we decided go all in an buy a new washer, Samsung got our attention on reviews and presentation. And when we used it for the first time we finally fall in love with it. First of all the HE technology saves a lot on water, detergent and softener, and second the noise reduction we don't even notice that is running. We also requested a Gas Dryer that will take a little while to arrive since it is special order, that will complete our new Laundry. Thanks for such a great product so far we are super happy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
5.0,"""Better than expected!""",This is our first front loading washer and was a little skeptical. So far it has out preformed our expectations. The laundry takes less time to do now and each load has cleaned up great. The Samsung dryer we have is the perfect compliment for finishing our laundry. The clothes come out softer and cleaner than ever before.
5.0,"""Awesome""","Only Samsung in my House. The best performing products on earth. And, when there is an issue, they do not hesitate to resolve the issue. Complete customer satisfaction. ?"
4.0,"""Washing clothes seems simpler now""",Just replaced our 10yr old top load machine with this new unit. based on reviews I went ahead made the purchase. Its nice - has some great features. Read the manual it will make the process smoother and simpler. Unit does take some getting used to but overall very happy with the purchase.

4.0,"""New Front Load""",We just got our new frontload washer to replace our old top load. The washer plenty of bells and whistles and looks great. The washer seems to use a lot less water which should cut down on the bills.
5.0,"""This washer exceeded all our expetations and is a beautiful appliance!!!""","The very first load of laundry we did, we noticed cleaner and softer items once out of the dryer. We currently have a Maytag dryer that we are now looking forward to replacing with the matching Samsung Dryer. If the washer is this good we can only imagine what the dryer will do. It truly pays to buy quality appliances!!!"

5.0,"""This washer works great""","Only had this washer a few weeks, works great, clothes are very clean, saves water."
5.0,"""This product gives needed options""","Our old washer simply had ""one speed"" no matter what we were washing. The new Samsung Front Loading washer allows us to set the machine to handle the need, especially to get the really dirty cloths clean. The machine is quiet and the spin really gets most of the moisture out of the load. We like it a lot"
5.0,"""This product has great features""","This is my first front load high efficiency washer and so far I love everything about it. I have the pedestal, which I recommend, otherwise you will be bending over a lot to load/unload it. There are lots of cycles to choose from to meet your every need. There is a nice dispenser tray to put the laundry soap, fabric softener and bleach. Unit is much quieter than my previous washer. Does a great job on the clothes, they come out only a little damp and not wrinkled or wadded up into a roll. The little add a door is an awesome feature since it allows you to add a forgotten item."
5.0,"""Love it!""",I upgraded from a 15 year old washer and dryer. I LOVE the front load Add-Wash washer. I have the 5 cu ft and it is huge! What used to take 3 loads to wash now only takes one. I have severe allergies and washing my bedding and pillows with the sanitize or allergy setting seems to be helping. I have had this for 2 months and so far I haven't had any problems with it.
5.0,"""Finally Love Doing Laundry""","I bought this washer to replace a top load washer I had for 6 years. I am thrilled with the capacity, features and how clean my clothes are now. The clothes come out smelling fresh and have very little wrinkles. It's now a pleasure to do laundry. Thank you Samsung!"

5.0,"""I Love the new features of this washer especially the Adwash window.""",This washer replaces a Samsung stainless washer that is just 5 years old which I gave to a friend. It is amazing how the technology has improved in just 5 years. I actually prefer the black stainless color to the straight stainless color.
5.0,"""So happy we made this purchase!""","We have only had this product for less than a week , as we purchased it together with a dryer -- but we have put it to use this weekend in order to provide an accurate review. It works WONDERFULLY! It is very fast, pretty quiet and the clothes came out smelling soo so good. WE ARE EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT! Definitely recommend this product! !!"
3.0,"""Washer Issues""","I love Samsung products but the front loader isn't that great.1. After a cycle ended, I was unable to open the door. I tried resetting the washer by unplugging it but that did not work. Next, I selected the Rise & Spin cycle to work and it was my solution.2. On two different occasions for small loads, excess water was sitting in the drum and once again I used the Rise and Spin cycle to remove the water. Keep in mind that I only had the washer for a few weeks and is unsatisfied with it's performance."
5.0,"""Great Washer""",Love washing clothes when I know they will be taken care of.
5.0,"""Great washer!""","My wife wanted a washer with the most capacity under 29 inches in width, and this one fit the bill perfectly. It has tons of features and we've already noticed a big difference in how clean our clothes come out. Granted we were replacing an almost 15 year old washer, but nonetheless, this one does a great job.  This washer does have the AddWash feature in which you can add clothes after you have already started the cycle. This wasn't too important for us, and was the main factor in giving this washer 4 stars for design. Barely graze the door, and it will pop open which will prevent your washer from continuing on through the cycles until you close it. In fact, it happened on the first wash we ran. We got an error code and I went through the manual to determine the problem. Door popped open. We have cabinets behind the washer which you have to lean forward to get to. I guess I touched it enough with my leg that it opened. So stay clear once you press the start button. :) Not a big deal. Especially now that we are conscious of it, and make sure we don't pop it open. However, for future models, I believe it's something Samsung needs to correct.  Overall, a great washer and I advise taking the time to read the instruction manual. It doesn't take too terribly long, and you will learn a lot about all the features this washer has to offer as well as get the maximum cleaning ability.  I hope this one lasts as long as my previous washer."
4.0,"""New Front Load""",We just got our new frontload washer to replace our old top load. The washer plenty of bells and whistles and looks great. The washer seems to use a lot less water which should cut down on the bills.
5.0,"""This product has a locking feature that protects a user from injury while it is being used.""",The Washer is so quiet you hardly know it is on. The push button features takes the guess work out of the functions.
3.0,"""This product is not that great!!""",The clothes still smells after washing for 1 hour.
5.0,"""Does a Great Job and Has Great Features.""","This washer replaced a different brand front loading washer that we had for 11 years. This washer has the same exterior dimensions as the washer it replaced; however, the drum has a lot more capacity. It does a great job washing our clothes and is much quieter than our old washer. I love the Add Wash feature. I usually find something, especially a sock, that fell out of the pile as it was carried to the laundry room and not having to cancel the cycle to put it in the washer is a brilliant feature."
4.0,"""Its Beautiful""","The Washer has about 5 cycles, I'd never use. It needs a towel setting. The washer is beautiful. I didnt received the SmartHome remote yet. Its quiet. Clothes are clean. Short cycles"
5.0,"""Makes washing fun!""",We have enjoyed our new washer. Have not had to use the little 'add wash' door but probably will at some point. I like the lighted drum and the extra large size. I enjoy the tune it plays at the end of the cycle--better than a buzzer. Wash times are shorter than I was used to but I haven't noticed any lessening of cleaning. Many cycles and choices. Sometimes the touch pad seems not to be sensitive enough. I also have not had a lot of time to explore all the options it offers. It is a heavy machine!

5.0,"""Great product""","Beautiful washer w/a lot of wash modes. Power foam, add wash door nice addition"
4.0,"""Good washer....with a couple of caveats....""","This is a good washer...our first front loader, and overall its a pleasure to use compared to our old top loader. However I have a few complaints that make me uncertain if I would buy this again: 1. The ""AddWash"" feature is virtually useless. If you want to add items to the wash, it is easier to just push pause and open the normal door. Meanwhile the extra trap door adds depth to the size of the washer, makes it harder to see inside the washer, and creates extra parts to worry about keeping dry after use. 2. The ""hot"" water cycles are not hot. The ""Very hot"" cycle does get very hot, but it is a 2 1/2 hour cycle. For a normal hot water wash, it will be barely warm. It is not clear if this is completely because of government regulations, and therefore every brand of washer will have the same issue, or if its Samsung's fault. We had technicians come and check things out, and they told us that Samsung assures us that there is no negative effect on the washing performance based on the temperature of the water in the ""hot"" water cycle. I am not sure about that, and even if it is true, whose idea was it to redefine ""hot"" and not be upfront and tell the consumer that when they choose the ""hot"" setting that it will not actually be hot?"

4.0,"""High Capacity Washer""","I bought this washer because I'm able to wash a King size comforter in it thereby skipping the occasional launder mat visit. I can wash a lot more clothes in one load. Also, it does a good job steaming heavily soiled items. Only con is that it is a bit loud even after ensuring it was properly balanced."
5.0,"""An ECO that works!""","Ever since this ""Green"" life style was forced upon us & agitators were removed from washing machines, actual cleaning of dirty clothes took a back seat to carbon footprints... lol.Our last top-load machine was recalled & the refund went towards this machine.We decided on a front load, due to the lack-luster performance of the top load non-agitator style. The difference was like night & day, using the same detergent. My shirts smelled clean again, stains started disappearing & they were much softer.The only drawback that I can think of is that the music can't be changed."

5.0,"""Quiet And Efficient""","Our Washing machine is on the opposite side of a wall from our living room, so noise level is important. With this machine, the only thing we hear is the beep when it finishes a cleaning (which we want). Our last HE top loader often left residue from dirt, etc. left behind after the wash. Definitely not the case with this unit."

5.0,"""Great Washer""",I have always been a top loader user but am enjoying this front loader washer. Our clothes and bedding have come out much cleaner than in the past.

5.0,"""Great looking washer""","Very modern/high tech appearance, goes great with our kitchen stainless steel and dark stainless products. Much better looking than our old Duet. Controls a little complicated, need to look at manual, but you catch on fast. The lighted tub is great, never seen in a washer before. Have used for 2 weeks now, very happy with it. Not sure I'll pay extra for the wireless feature, as doubt we'd use it."
5.0,"""Great Product""","This washer is AWESOME! Starting with the look, it's sleek and modern. It has great features and the one that stands out the most is the steam. I could tell a huge difference in the cleanliness of my clothes from the very first load and next few loads didn't disappoint either. I was actually able to wash a full basket of jeans and each and every one came out fresh and clean, not extremely wrinkled and the spin was perfect! No dripping clothes. I love all of the choices of functions and it is very quiet. It also saves on water. So far it has lived up to all the hype."

4.0,"""Great Washer with Great Features""",So far I am very satisfied with this washer especially moving from a top load to a front load. Great features and it cleans really well. Looking forward to the steam and sanitize functions but they add hours to the cycle and that seems strange to me. Very efficient and low cost on energy.
5.0,"""It's like it isn't even there...""","This washing machine is by far the quietest machine I have ever owned! It cleans the cloths superbly as expected. 5.0 cu. ft. drum means BIG loads! Washed a king sized comforter with no problems. The add wash feature is absolutely a-must-have. Sure enough, having kiddos in the house a sock is going to go missing and be found after you've already started a load in the washer. Oh but no worries, having the add wash feature allowed us to add that sock to the rest of the load so it could be washed too. No more wasted water and extra spin cycles just to add a small item to the washer anymore. THANK YOU SAMSUNG!"

4.0,"""Excellent Washing Machine""","We purchased this washing machine on 8/4/16. I use it every night to wash jiu jitsu gis and athletic wear. In the past few weeks I have used it at least 40 times and have thus far not had any issues with the washing machine. The machine is very quiet and it runs well and smoothly. It has not gone out too out of balance and when it does it does not rock.  The best feature about the washing machine is the sanitize function. Some of my synthetic athletic wear has begun to stink from use and bacteria growth overtime. However, after washing the athletic wear using the sanitize function a majority of the smell has disappeared. The sanitize function uses steam in order to clean the items, but it is significantly longer than a normal wash cycle. Thus I only run this cycle once in a while when the clothes begin to stink.  Additionally the larger load capacity saves time while doing laundry on the weekend.  The washing machine is a bit pricey but so far it has been worth the money.  I would definitely recommend the washing machine."
5.0,"""Great so far!""","I've had this washer for 9 days and I run it from morning to night - trying to catch up after 30 days of not having a washer over the holiday (TG). Things to know: when washing towels use 1/2 of the amount of liquid detergent you would normally use; otherwise, you will have to run a rinse and spin cycle to remove all the excess soap. Delicate cycle is best for knit clothes - permanent press is great for denim or heavier material. Disclaimer, I am not a professional laundress (I just play one at home)! Please follow the manufactures guidelines. The add wash feature - pause the machine open the small door and add your item(s) - its easy and fast! No worries of water or soap dripping on the floor. Great feature - didn't think I would use it much, but I do. When reading this review know that I am a Samsung fan, therefore; I am bias."
5.0,"""Best washer I have ever had.""","I love the efficiency and variety of features that you get on this washer. Haven't had a load come out bad yet. You can even customize your washes to your needs, and save it to a single button. The add an item feature and shoot are great too. It seems that I occasionally find at least one more item I wish I had added to a load, and now I can easily. You won't go wrong with this washer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
