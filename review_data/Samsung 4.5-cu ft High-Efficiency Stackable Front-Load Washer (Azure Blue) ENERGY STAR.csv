5.0,"""Wonderful""","This Samsung replaced a top loading Maytag bought this February. Yes, you read that right. I could not be happier with this front loader. What I like about it. Easy to operate. Nice large detergent, bleach and softener dispenser that slides in and out easily. You can also remove it completely and clean it and pop it back in. Nice large door. Filter easy to remove and clean and reinstall. Easy to add laundry after the cycle has started, I do this all the time. Washes great, rinses great, spins great. We did sit ours on the matching pedestal. Our house is a 67 year old, one story slab house. Drain in the small washroom. Had some trouble getting it level because of the location of the drain and size of the room. It's level now, solid and no movement on the gorilla shake test. It still jiggles and bounces a tad. Balancing the load helps tremendously. Nice big door to make loading easier. Okay, I do like the blue!What I don't like about it, I think all front loaders should have an interior light period. Whether it's top of the line to the bottom of the line.  After I use my washer, I always take out the dispenser and clean it and dry it. I always, always take a cloth and clean the inside of the door, making sure it's dry. I dry the rubber seal getting all around and inside the seal. Pull the seal away from the bottom of the washer and dry it good also. I've had a front loader in the past, I know where the mold can form. I also always, always leave the door open."

1.0,"""Operates as designed, but doesn't wash""","The literature on this washer says it washes by pushing water through the clothes rather than pushed the clothes through the water. This sounds like a nice idea, but the fact is it uses so little water that find yourself increasing the washer time and ""soiled"" level to maximum on average loads just to get a decent wash. And even then, if you have children, many of their stains will not come in one wash. This was not an issue with my previous 15 year old washer. Probably because it pushed clothes through the water rather than water through the clothes. I am very comfortable with the idea of water conserving washing machines, but this machine does not conserve if every load takes 1.5 hours, on max soil, to complete. One last thing, if you choose to wash a load of towels - pre-soak them, otherwise they will absorb the water the machine uses and you will watch wet towels rolling around for 1.5 hours."
5.0,,"I purchased this washer and dryer set a week ago. So far I am very pleased. My clothes come out very clean and fresh smelling. The washer is quiet, can barely hear it on the spin cycle. I went from a 4.2 front loader to a 4.5 , and I couldn't believe what a difference that made. I would definitely recommend this product! Good Job Samsung!"
