4.0,"""So far so good, HOWEVER........""","Why so many problems with this washer later on in years?  Look at this site:  https://www.google.com/search?q=spider+problems+with+Samsung+washers&ie;=utf-8&oe;=utf-8It deals with the Spider bracket the holds the drum, the metal corrodes due to incompatible metals joined together. So will this washer only last maybe 5 years until drum starts shaking?"
5.0,"""Great machine and adapters are now available""","Purchased this and the matching dryer during Memorial day sale. Lowes delivery was great and they installed it on our custom pedestal with care for the walls etc. The machine works great and handles all the laundry my family of 5 can throw at it. The wifi adapters weren't available on the samsung site at the time (not even listed). About 2 weeks later they were listed and I ordered them, but they were out of stock and on backorder. They came into stock the last week of June and were here via fedex in a couple of days. Easy setup for those with our home router. The positive controls of the machines is a neat feature, but we really love getting the alerts when the cycles are done on our phones in case you are out of range of the chime. The clothes are cleaner than our other washer/dryer set, they dry faster, and the machines are quieter. Even with high speed spin, you might hear it spinning, but ZERO vibration through the machines/floor/walls/etc which is important because ours is on the second floor near bedrooms. I did make sure to purchase new stainless hoses with flow controls (had them in the past and they are worth it) and bought the protection plan (one pump or LED screen and it will pay off quick)."
3.0,"""Good idea. Good concept. Poor quality""",I purchased this washer and dryer set and had it delivered on may 17th 2016. The product arrived just fine. Within the first 5hrs of using it I noticed that 2 of the led lights to for the modes were not working on the dryer. I called Samsung and they stated that it's cosmetic and does not affect functionality therefor if I wanted it fixed it would be up to Lowe's or out of my own pocket.  Second off it states there is an available wifi module to connect the set up to wifi and control or monitor remotely. This is the feature that swayed me from lg as I have a lot of nice clothes and if for some reason I was out a little longer than expected I would love the option to turn on the wrinkle free setting remotely so I don't have to fight and iron extremely wrinkled clothes later or run them thru a steam cycle. I iron daily bit if you have ever tried to iron severely wrinkled clothes you know how much of a pain that is. Well samsung had no clue to what this adapter was. Said both my new washer and dryer was broke and wanted to send someone to fix it. After several phone calls and multiple supervisors I was finally informed that this is not released yet and should be out by the end of the year. Pretty messed up as all documentation says it's available now.  On a positive note the washer and dryer work great at cleaning and drying clothes. I have never had or used a washer and dryer that performed so well. If Samsung could get their act together and know/support their products this would have easily been rated 5 stars in all categories. Had it not been for the above issues I would recommend these to anyone and everyone. If I ever have to buy anothwr washer and dryer I will seriously be giving LG a good long look and probably going with LG in the future. If your u can deal with the potential issues and have no worries about maybe eventually getting the wifi adapters then I would highly recommend these as they clean and dry clothing on a whole new level.
3.0,"""Washes well until filter clogs""","Long story short: Washes well but pump/debris filter needs to be cleaned (human/pet hair) every 2-3 weeks, much more often than Samsung advises! Even if you manually drain residual water from machine, about a QUART gushes out when filter is opened. Unacceptable to me and probably most others but Samsung claims this is ""normal?"" Good luck...!"
4.0,"""Beautiful machine with vibration issue""","I received my beautiful new washing machine on December 2nd 2016 and the first load of wash shook the machine so hard that the corner piece of the pedestal shook off of the machine.  This was not a huge load, but did include two pairs of jeans, two towels and socks and underwear.  I will adjust my rating later if I see an improvement."
2.0,"""new waher dosen't workin""",I bought this washer 4 days ago new last night I calibrated and I stard washing it dosen't finish the cycle and sounds like a train and it moves so bad that scratched my new paint. They are going to replace it but lets see how it goes 9/14/16
1.0,"""HORRIBLE customer service""","Received this matched set couple of days before Thanksgiving, 2016.The installers failed to properly setup washer. The interior light didn't work. Had issues with the washer being balanced. Didn't know until the installers had left. While they were here I pointed out that it wasn't balanced and they adjusted it a little bit. Lo and behold, first load squeaked loudly.To top this off, I contacted Samsung and their service repair a specialist would contact me within 24-48 hours.Six 6 Days later I call back to find out my ticket was cancelled! The manager told me don't know why. This is my first experience with Samsung and probably my last! I will NOT recommend Samsung appliances to any friends. Maybe an enemy.lol"

3.0,"""good but...""","I bought the matching dryer and I have to stack the units. These are very tall when stacked and I am 5'6"" and less and I would have to use a step stool. I do not have the pedestal under them. When the washer is done there seems to be alot of residual water left, I am concerned about this and will be watching carefully for the next couple of loads."

3.0,"""FRONT LOADERS SEEM THE SAME""","I love the look of the washer but on three separate occasions, half loads were did not drain well.

5.0,"""Great Energy Edficient Washer""","Purchased the Samsung 5.0 Washer after much research and learning it not only had the largest capacity in its class, but great and desirable features like add wash so you can add things you forget to a load like a top loading washer, steam wash, and of course super energy and water efficiency. I'd highly recommend this washer to anyone."
5.0,"""Great washer""",I've been using a stackable for years and decided to get a newer model. I'd heard front loaders are the best at getting your wash clean and am not disappointed. Comforters that always came out not so clean are almost like new again! I LOVE this washer!
5.0,"""Quiet and large capacity""","Love the large capacity of this washer. We are able to wash our king sized sheet set, 2 twin sheet sets, and a crib sheet all in one load! The washer is very quiet. It neighbors our family room, and we cannot hear it running while watching movies! This washer has simplified our laundry workload each week, highly recommend!"
5.0,"""Love it!""","This new Samsung washer is excellent. Upgraded from a decent front load. This unit has lots of features for different washing needs. Being a family of 5 with 3 kids, we go through a ton of clothes and this unit does a great job washing. Love this purchase."

5.0,"""Greatest  Washer""",I purchased the machine over a month ago after returning my LG top of the line machine. What a difference in the wash and quietness of the machine. This machine works well and is quiet and I love the front shoot as I'm always forgetting something.
3.0,"""Washes great but not when filter clogs""","Long story short: Washes well but pump/debris filter needs to be cleaned (human/pet hair) every 2-3 weeks, much more often than Sumsung advises! Even if you manually drain residual water from machine, about a QUART gushes out when filter is opened. Unacceptable to me and probably most others but Samsung claims this is ""normal?"" Good luck...!"
5.0,"""Exceeded expectations""","We replaced a top load washer with this one. We were drawn to all the features. My wife couldn't stop bragging on this machine after the first day of use. She was amazed at how clean the towels came out after using the sanitize cycle. She continues to say how she loves how the clothes come out with less water retention after the spin cycle and therefore dry faster. Finally, she claims the clothes are less wrinkled with this machine. Yes it may cost more than some, but we believe it is definitely worth it."
5.0,"""Enjoying my new washer!""","So far so good, installed and operational. Seems to be doing a great job, loads better than the previous washer I owned. (pun intended)"
5.0,"""This model has great features.""",We had a Samsung washer before we got this one. We are very happy with all the features of this model.
5.0,"""Great Purchase""","So far this has been a great washer. The capacity is huge, it easily fit 9 pairs of jeans with no trouble and spun them adequately dry. The controls are easy to read and use and there are many choices of cycles. The normal cycle is fast - 45 minutes. It's super quite and has very little vibration (even with the 9 pairs of jeans during the spin cycle). Made my white T-shirts look like new. A little pricey but worth the price - just wait for a sale."
5.0,"""Exceptional Quality and Performance""",I purchased this washer recently and must say that I am very impressed with it so far. I had another washer for over 20 years and got very good service from it. I am hoping that this Samsung Washer can give me the same if not more long years of service as my original washer. I bought this Samsung Washer because of the company's very good brand name and its commitment to producing exceptional products. I am hoping that I am not disappointed. Thank you.
5.0,"""Great Product""",Everything you want in a washer and more A+++++++++

The features are awesome... very simple to operate and it does a great job in washing clothes. I would recommend to anyone looking for a front load washer, definitely one of the best out there right now."
5.0,"""Great Washer""","Went from a top load to a side load. Love the difference. Cleans great and very quiet. Bought the home adapter, which is nice because when load is finshed it notifies me, cuz I have a tendency to forget about it. I also recommend the pedestals, makes loading and unloading much easier."
4.0,"""Love the addwash""","By the second load of laundry, we are already using the addwash door. It is a great feature for anyone with kids that leave clothes everywhere! The only con so far is that the buttons are not sensitive enough. While changing functions, it doesn't register my finger touch on the button or it is delayed, thus skipping over my selection as I have pressed the button 3 extra times by the time it catches up."
5.0,"""Frontloading Clothes Washer""","Very easy to operate, lots of great features like Allergen, Sanitize, Deep Steam, eco cold, bedding, to list a few. Love the add item window in front too."

5.0,"""So far we are pleased""",We have had this unit for over a month now and are very pleased with the washer overall. It replaced a Kenmore Elite that I purchased from regretfully from a Sears outlet (don't recommend) and the unit after 3 tries wasn't fixed. I did my research and settled on this unit. We are pleased with the features and functions along with its performance. It is quiet and so far has done a great job on everything from stains to larger items like blankets and sheets.

5.0,"""Better than expected!""",This is our first front loading washer and was a little skeptical. So far it has out preformed our expectations. The laundry takes less time to do now and each load has cleaned up great. The Samsung dryer we have is the perfect compliment for finishing our laundry. The clothes come out softer and cleaner than ever before.
5.0,"""I Love this Washer!!""","This product repalces a 15 year old other brand front-loading washer. The Samsung has so many wonderful features the old one didn't. I especially like the ability to adjust the time of various wash cycles as i believe some things should be washed for longer periods of time if very dirty, Also the add-a garmet feature as i am always finding 1 or 2 items that need to be added to a cycle already started.. We very much like the ease of use, very clear control panel, (& the fact that it 'sings' to me at the end of cycle, etc. all & all a very nice product to use & own."

5.0,"""SAMSUNG WASHER""","Convenient size, cleans well and gentle on clothes, nice color,"
4.0,"""The design features are very attractive.""","Overall, I really do like this washer. The design is very impressive and eye-catching. I haven't tried them yet, but there are several nice features, such as, sanitizing, allergen and deep steam. It saves detergent products due to functioning with less water It functions well on the normal, delicate whites, etc. settings, I like that. However, when I tried to wash a small heavy rug, I placed it on heavy duty and extra high spin, but it just would not spin the water out, I had to line dry the rug, that did not make me a happy. It would be nice if it had an ""add extra water"" feature, and I think clear glass in the front would be better (maybe not as ""space age"" looking), but at least I would be able to see what my washer is doing at a glance; I miss those 2 features."
4.0,"""Washing clothes seems simpler now""",Just replaced our 10yr old top load machine with this new unit. based on reviews I went ahead made the purchase. Its nice - has some great features. Read the manual it will make the process smoother and simpler. Unit does take some getting used to but overall very happy with the purchase.
5.0,"""Samsung front load washer.""","My husband bought me this washer and matching dryer for Christmas we have partially redone my utility room, my husband made a pedestal to put them up on so I don't have to bend over to load and unload, I love them both."
5.0,"""Gets clothes very clean.""","Our old washer just wasn't getting the clothing clean anymore, in fact sometimes it wouldn't even get the clothes wet. If I did get the clothes wet, it wouldn't spin out all the water so everything was still very saturated. So we decided to get a new washing machine with a couple key features as a must. Large capacity was the number one feature we wanted the most because we do a lot of laundry andfront load be use they are known to get clothing cleaner. upon hours of research we decided to get this Samsung 5.0 addwash. We didn't really care too much about the addwash feature and we rarely actually use it, but it does come in handy at times when you do not want to open the whole door to throw in 1 sock. My girlfriend is a nurse and gets in messy situations sometimes so we always wash her scrubs on the sanitize function, however that cycle takes a long times to wash, around 2-3 hours if I recally correctly. But a normal cycle takes around 45 minutes even with fabric softener, which I found in my research other brands adds time and you must hit a button for softener. So I liked the fact that you don't hit any special buttons and does not add time. But if you hit the super speed button on the normal cycle it cuts about 15 minutes off of the total wash time. I don't always use it because when I do, I usually end up waiting on the dryer to catch up. I have tried the super speed a few times and it does seem to clean just as well as the normal times cycle. It also has a self clean feature in which you do not have to have any extra cleansers to clean the tub and it tells you to run the self clean cycle after 40 cycles to reduce the risk of mold and mildew that front loads have a reputation of. I have run the self clean feature twice already in just over a month and a half of use and haven't had any problems with it. The self clean feature does take almost 4 hours to complete with seems like a very long time but I usually do it before I go to bed. all in all I love this washer and I believe it is worth very penny. Last thing is that after each cycle it plays a little song as if the washer is so happy that it got to do some work."
5.0,"""LOVE my Samsung Washer and Dryer""","So easy to use. I was skeptical about going with the HE washer and dryer. Especially this one that has no agitator. But it has made a believer out of me. I heard horror stories about mold building up in the drum. The salesperson told us that as long as you follow the instructions in the owners manual and keep the door open between wash loads so it can dry out, nothing will happen. He pointed out that the military has used front loaders for years. Well, if its good enough for Uncle Sam, its good enough for me. I have cut down tremendously on the amount of detergent I use. Unbelievable the money saved in that alone."

5.0,"""AMAZING!!""","I bought this to replace my 2008 Samsung front load washing machine. What a difference 9 years makes!!! My washing machine is on the 2nd floor and it does no shake the entire house during any of its cycles. In fact, you don't even know when it starts to spin!!! Never thought I would say I'm happy my older one broke!! LUV IT!!"
5.0,"""This product has great features""","This is my first front load high efficiency washer and so far I love everything about it. I have the pedestal, which I recommend, otherwise you will be bending over a lot to load/unload it. There are lots of cycles to choose from to meet your every need. There is a nice dispenser tray to put the laundry soap, fabric softener and bleach. Unit is much quieter than my previous washer. Does a great job on the clothes, they come out only a little damp and not wrinkled or wadded up into a roll. The little add a door is an awesome feature since it allows you to add a forgotten item."
5.0,"""Love all features""",This been the most exciting product I ever purchased.
5.0,"""Best washer ever""","I just got this washer and dryer a few days ago and it is the best washer I have ever had. I replaced a 3 year old Maytag Bravos XL that did a horrible job. So far the cloths come out cleaner and have fewer wrinkles then the Maytag. I am amazed at how quiet the washer is compared to my last one. Very happy I went back to a front load rather then a top load. The size is perfect and I just finished washing a king comforter and it came out perfect. I also purchased the 15"" pedestals and it makes the machines just the right height for loading and unloading. I also played around with the AddWash door to see how that work and it is pretty cool. My last front loaders were LG and I had them for 8 years and had nothing but problems from day one. Very happy I went with Samsung."
4.0,"""Love the look and features""","We haven't had the washer very long but have been very happy so far. Love the way it looks. Like the small door to not only add other small items during the wash, but to leave open to air out the washer so it doesn't get mildew smell."

So many cycles and features. Ordered Smart Home module but taking too long to recieve! Hoping Smart Home will help notify me when washer is finished while working around the house."
5.0,"""This product gives needed options""","Our old washer simply had ""one speed"" no matter what we were washing. The new Samsung Front Loading washer allows us to set the machine to handle the need, especially to get the really dirty cloths clean. The machine is quiet and the spin really gets most of the moisture out of the load. We like it a lot"

I tried resetting the washer by unplugging it but that did not work. Next, I selected the Rise & Spin cycle to work and it was my solution.2. On two different occasions for small loads, excess water was sitting in the drum and once again I used the Rise and Spin cycle to remove the water. Keep in mind that I only had the washer for a few weeks and is unsatisfied with it's performance."
5.0,"""Great washer!""","My wife wanted a washer with the most capacity under 29 inches in width, and this one fit the bill perfectly. It has tons of features and we've already noticed a big difference in how clean our clothes come out. Granted we were replacing an almost 15 year old washer, but nonetheless, this one does a great job.  This washer does have the AddWash feature in which you can add clothes after you have already started the cycle. This wasn't too important for us, and was the main factor in giving this washer 4 stars for design. Barely graze the door, and it will pop open which will prevent your washer from continuing on through the cycles until you close it. In fact, it happened on the first wash we ran. We got an error code and I went through the manual to determine the problem. Door popped open. We have cabinets behind the washer which you have to lean forward to get to. I guess I touched it enough with my leg that it opened. So stay clear once you press the start button. :) Not a big deal. Especially now that we are conscious of it, and make sure we don't pop it open. However, for future models, I believe it's something Samsung needs to correct.  Overall, a great washer and I advise taking the time to read the instruction manual. It doesn't take too terribly long, and you will learn a lot about all the features this washer has to offer as well as get the maximum cleaning ability.  I hope this one lasts as long as my previous washer."
5.0,"""This washer exceeded all our expetations and is a beautiful appliance!!!""","The very first load of laundry we did, we noticed cleaner and softer items once out of the dryer. We currently have a Maytag dryer that we are now looking forward to replacing with the matching Samsung Dryer. If the washer is this good we can only imagine what the dryer will do. It truly pays to buy quality appliances!!!"
5.0,"""This product has so many features.""",LOVE all the different features! This washer has it all. I especially like the sanitizing cycle having 5 pets!
5.0,"""An ECO that works!""","Ever since this ""Green"" life style was forced upon us & agitators were removed from washing machines, actual cleaning of dirty clothes took a back seat to carbon footprints... lol.Our last top-load machine was recalled & the refund went towards this machine.We decided on a front load, due to the lack-luster performance of the top load non-agitator style. The difference was like night & day, using the same detergent. My shirts smelled clean again, stains started disappearing & they were much softer.The only drawback that I can think of is that the music can't be changed."
5.0,"""Love washer""",Love this washer. My only concern is that after each wash I have to leave it open so that it airs out and dries. For that reason is why I lowered the design to four stars and of course it is a bit expensive so the value did suffer as well.
3.0,"""This product is not that great!!""",The clothes still smells after washing for 1 hour.
5.0,"""Does a Great Job and Has Great Features.""","This washer replaced a different brand front loading washer that we had for 11 years. This washer has the same exterior dimensions as the washer it replaced; however, the drum has a lot more capacity. It does a great job washing our clothes and is much quieter than our old washer. I love the Add Wash feature. I usually find something, especially a sock, that fell out of the pile as it was carried to the laundry room and not having to cancel the cycle to put it in the washer is a brilliant feature."
5.0,"""Love my new washer!""","At first I was worried about switching from a top load to a front load because I had never used one growing up or in my own home. After using it, I LOVE it!! I was excited about the steam feature on it because I had read steam helps get set in stains out. I have used it every time I have washed my whites and I can tell a huge difference. This washer has more features that my Samsung top load and I have loved every one of them. I also, like how big the capacity is! It makes it easier to wash our King size comforter in it! Thank you Samsung for all the great products you come out with!"
4.0,"""Its Beautiful""","The Washer has about 5 cycles, I'd never use. It needs a towel setting. The washer is beautiful. I didnt received the SmartHome remote yet. Its quiet. Clothes are clean. Short cycles"
5.0,"""love my new washer""",I love the addwash! I always forget clothes. With my old machine I would make a mess opening it to add clothes but this one is perfect for me!
5.0,"""Love my washer""","Although we just received our new washer and I have only done a couple loads with it I am very pleased. It looks great and the clothes are completed in a reasonable period of time. I am hoping this one lasts a long time. My last two washers, other brands and uprights, did not last long at all just a couple years."
5.0,"""Gotta See it to Believe!""","Samsung has built an incredible washer. It is SO efficient and easy to use. I purchased it from a Big Box Store and they delivered it to my second floor laundry a no cost. The difference in this machine and the front loading brand it replaced (5 years old) is absolutely astounding. I am a believer in Samsung Products. Phones, TV, Dryers, Washers...you name it and I put my faith in what they say. .. thanks Samsung for great trustworthy manufacturing and customer service."
5.0,"""Makes washing fun!""",We have enjoyed our new washer. Have not had to use the little 'add wash' door but probably will at some point. I like the lighted drum and the extra large size. I enjoy the tune it plays at the end of the cycle--better than a buzzer. Wash times are shorter than I was used to but I haven't noticed any lessening of cleaning. Many cycles and choices. Sometimes the touch pad seems not to be sensitive enough. I also have not had a lot of time to explore all the options it offers. It is a heavy machine!
5.0,"""Excellent and Powerful Washing Machine""",Never in my life have I had a washing machine so quiet. The new small door that allows you to add additional laundry you may have forgotten is amazing!
5.0,"""This product is a leader.""","We replaced a top line Kenmore Elite with this model. We are getting used to all the new features that are available to use; and find this unit is simple, functional and quiet. Just remember to follow the cleaning recommendations.."
5.0,"""Front Loading Washer""","Great features, quiet operation, Great Cleaning. More routine maintenance required than expected: (Drain Filter)"
4.0,"""High Capacity Washer""","I bought this washer because I'm able to wash a King size comforter in it thereby skipping the occasional launder mat visit. I can wash a lot more clothes in one load. Also, it does a good job steaming heavily soiled items. Only con is that it is a bit loud even after ensuring it was properly balanced."
5.0,"""Washingitallaway""","My washer broke and I was ready for something more modern. When I researched washers, this one was it. Although I couldn't get a demonstration in the store, the washer lived up to all the positive reviews I saw online. I absolutely love how quickly and cleaner it washes, and I am happy to save on dry cleaning. To top it off, my daughter loves the musical tones it plays at the end of the cycle opposed to the loud buzzer from my old washer."
5.0,"""Finally have my dream washer!""",I have been waiting years to purchase a front load washer. This is great. The large capacity allows me to wash bedding that would not fit in my old washer. Clothes come out great with all the selections available. Very happy with my purchase.
5.0,"""Washer has some good features""",We just had the washer installed today. Took and washed and load of towels and some whites. The washer did a great job. Will update in a few weeks to let you know how it is washing

5.0,"""Quiet And Efficient""","Our Washing machine is on the opposite side of a wall from our living room, so noise level is important. With this machine, the only thing we hear is the beep when it finishes a cleaning (which we want). Our last HE top loader often left residue from dirt, etc. left behind after the wash. Definitely not the case with this unit."

5.0,"""Best washer I have ever had.""","I love the efficiency and variety of features that you get on this washer. Haven't had a load come out bad yet. You can even customize your washes to your needs, and save it to a single button. The add an item feature and shoot are great too. It seems that I occasionally find at least one more item I wish I had added to a load, and now I can easily. You won't go wrong with this washer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

5.0,"""Excellent Washer""",This is the best washing machine we have ever had. It has all the features you could ever need. It is quiet and does a great job washing your clothes.
5.0,"""Great looking washer""","Very modern/high tech appearance, goes great with our kitchen stainless steel and dark stainless products. Much better looking than our old Duet. Controls a little complicated, need to look at manual, but you catch on fast. The lighted tub is great, never seen in a washer before. Have used for 2 weeks now, very happy with it. Not sure I'll pay extra for the wireless feature, as doubt we'd use it."
5.0,"""Great Product""","This washer is AWESOME! Starting with the look, it's sleek and modern. It has great features and the one that stands out the most is the steam. I could tell a huge difference in the cleanliness of my clothes from the very first load and next few loads didn't disappoint either. I was actually able to wash a full basket of jeans and each and every one came out fresh and clean, not extremely wrinkled and the spin was perfect! No dripping clothes. I love all of the choices of functions and it is very quiet. It also saves on water. So far it has lived up to all the hype."

5.0,"""Great Washer""",I have always been a top loader user but am enjoying this front loader washer. Our clothes and bedding have come out much cleaner than in the past. I wish we were able to get the pedastal but the washer and dryer were at the max of our budget. The washer does sit a little low without the pedastal but no different than any other front load washer.
5.0,"""Finally a washer that actually washes""",So far so good. This washer has exceeded our expectations and more.

4.0,"""So far it works great""",Other washers I have had the times adjust all over this washer seems to keep it spot on. It gets my clothes clean which is what you are asking for in the first place and I can hang dry them in about an hour. I'm thinking about getting the smart plug in..
5.0,"""So far so good.""",Excited to have a great product in our house to replace out 2 year old low price washer.
4.0,"""Great Washer with Great Features""",So far I am very satisfied with this washer especially moving from a top load to a front load. Great features and it cleans really well. Looking forward to the steam and sanitize functions but they add hours to the cycle and that seems strange to me. Very efficient and low cost on energy.
5.0,"""It's like it isn't even there...""","This washing machine is by far the quietest machine I have ever owned! It cleans the cloths superbly as expected. 5.0 cu. ft. drum means BIG loads! Washed a king sized comforter with no problems. The add wash feature is absolutely a-must-have. Sure enough, having kiddos in the house a sock is going to go missing and be found after you've already started a load in the washer. Oh but no worries, having the add wash feature allowed us to add that sock to the rest of the load so it could be washed too. No more wasted water and extra spin cycles just to add a small item to the washer anymore. THANK YOU SAMSUNG!"
