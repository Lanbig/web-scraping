4.0,"""quiet!""","I purchased the matching set about 2 months ago. Overall I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new set. (When we bought ours they were on sale. The set cost $1400 after taxes including the extended 3 year warranty which truly sold me. I'm so glad we purchased when we did looking at the prices now) There are a few things I've noticed that I'm not a huge fan of though. 1st being the depth. I am 5'6"" and I have to spin the barrel with my hand and tip toe to get any stray socks or small pieces of clothing. The height of the washer and dryer alone is a little odd. I have a hanging shelf above mine that seems to be just a standard height and I can't hang clothes on it or they bunch up at the bottom from laying on top of the set. Another issue I noticed right away is the detergent tray. I am such a forgetful person and I know the first time I forget to push the detergent tray in before I put the lid down the wash sink is probably going to break the tray. I find myself double and triple checking before I put the lid down. I love how quiet it runs. Even with large bulky loads you can't even hear your machine in the next room over. I have a king size bed and can wash all of my bedding (pillow cases comforter sheets etc) and still have room for more. The capacity of this is unreal! the setting have taken some getting used to and I'm still figuring them out. It seems like the wash time takes for ever on everything other than the quick wash setting. Other than the few small things mentioned I really feel like this has been a great purchase"
5.0,"""I love it!""","I waited to write my review to get to know how to operate the washer, and to allow time to make sure there weren't any problems. Well, it's been a year and I love it! I haven't had any problems with it. The sink is so convenient! I recommend it to friends and family. I bought the washer at Lowes at a great price,and there weren't any issues with delivery."
1.0,"""Worst Washer I've Ever Had""","We bought this washer 2 months ago and it is the worst washer I've ever used. It doesn't clean clothes. I have four kids and their clothes get really dirty and they come out with bits of food still stuck to them. My husband's socks still had some grass stuck on them from mowing the lawn and they came out looking exactly the same. My clothes, which weren't even that dirty, all come out with lint looking stuff all over them. Plus all of our clothes look a lot older like the machine is wearing them out. It is also impossible to get clothes out of the bottom so I have to use a wooden spoon to pull them up the sides. Plus, it doesn't get all the detergent out. I've read the manual multiple times, played around with the settings, adjusted the amount of detergent and nothing gets the clothes clean or new looking. I am so frustrated because we spent a lot of money on this machine and my very old machine (which sadly finally died) worked so much better and I'm sure cost about 1/3 of the price. Thankfully we got great customer service from Daniel at Lowes and will be able to trade this machine in for a different one."
5.0,"""Awesome""","After reading the negative reviews I almost didn't purchase this washer/dyer combo. I walked away and came back and stared at it, long enough to probably make the employee in the appliance section feel awkward... The sale that was going on at the time and the fact my washing machine (Electrolux) had just died hours before is what sold me and I ended up buying the combo. Thank god I chose to buy this! It may take an hour to wash your clothes but with that being said my family of 5 can completely do a weeks worth of laundry in 2 loads with this beast. It fits 10 freakin towels and that's me trying not to overload it. I use tide pods so it also saves me money on detergent. It has gotten unbalanced 1 time but it was when I only had 3-4 towels in it, but the manual does mention that small loads may become unbalanced. I highly recommend this combo to anyone, with my military discount on top of the sale I feel like I stole this from lowes... sorry not sorry. Just buy it"
1.0,"""WORST EVER!""",I had a great Maytag for 15 years.  Time to upgrade so got this one and do NOT recommend it.  It's always unbalanced so you have to keep opening it up and moving the lao.  Takes over an hour to do a load which is insane.   Going to go to LG and see if that is better.
1.0,"""Horrible!!!!""",Spin cycle always ends up being unbalanced. The load never finishes as it has to start the spin cycle over and over and over. Efficient?? I don't think so! Not in terms of water or energy. It takes 3x longer to finish a load compared to any other decent washer. Do not buy this washer! Please!
2.0,"""Big!""","I bought this washer about 6 weeks ago after my 9yo front loader started gushing water all over my upstairs laundry room.  I fell in love with the dual washer in the same finish, black stainless.(gorgeous but scratches easily and the scratches practically glow) That was out of my price range and this was right next to it.  I looked it over and saw how huge it was. Perfect for me, I have a large family.  I bought it, was delivered and installed no problem. We remodeled our laundry room around it. I was happy.  I used it for nearly a month and with help from the store salesperson returned it.  The new washer and dryer set was back ordered so I ended up with this for 6 weeks total.  First, what I really liked about this washer.  I liked the size, it's huge!  I went from washing 2-5 loads a day to 2-3.  It was awesome and I still miss the size.  All the settings were good.  The only problem I had with the settings is that it didn't have a steam or saniwash.  With small kids, very necessary. You've seen those bleach commercials, necessary.  Luckily the dryer has a sanitize option.  I loved the dryer.  If the washer was anywhere as good as the dryer, I would still have them.  The steam dryer with its great settings like the steam refresh, I miss that dryer.  Works better than my replacement dryer I think.  Same brand, same settings, but the one that came with this washer was just better, idk why.  I used the sink on this washer to treat stains. It mostly got in the way and I don't really know if it helped with stain removal.  The water for the sink only comes out cold.  It would be nice if it was the same setting as what you were washing.  I know cold water is better for pretreating, but the water in the sink ends up dumped into the wash.  The wash times seemed a bit long, but it washes very large loads.   Now, what made me return this washer.  I noticed the top layer of clothes sometimes didn't get clean.  So I started washing most loads on the deep wash setting which fills the drum to the top.  I still had the same problem.  I started washing smaller and smaller loads, same problem.  Then I started noticing that my detergent pods would leave this empty pod goo.  I was washing every load on deep wash and still a dirty top layer of clothes.  I could only assume that as the water level would rise the clothes would sometimes float up and just not sink down.  Oddly enough the week my new set was due to be delivered, this problem stopped.  Idk why.  I didn't change anything.  And I stopped having to do deep wash every wash. Which was great bc the water bill was pretty high that month.  Unfortunately I started getting the unbalanced code almost every load!  In 2 days I did 2 loads of laundry bc it would just stop and sit there unbalanced.  This drove me crazy.  I started washing smaller and smaller loads again. Still UB codes, so right when I was rethinking the return, I got a whole new reason to return it.  I'm re-redoing the laundry room as the new set is being stacked. Lots of work down the drain. I am glad that it's gone.  But, I kind of wish I could have that dryer back."
5.0,"""Great job washing clothes and it is very quiet!""","With the ratings on this machine, I was a little reluctant to purchase this washer. Lowes offers a 30 money back warranty so I figured I would give it a try. First off Lowes delivery folks are awesome! Second from reading the reviews, I was waiting for something terrible to happen. Not so. This does a fantastic job washing clothes towels etc. Everything is working 100% with no complications. I have not testing this on bedding yet and so I will add to this review in the next week or two. But so far so good! I would not have any problem recommending this Samsung washing machine."
2.0,"""Only for show""","I'm not one to whine or complain before trying something. Im not one to exaggerate either. DO not buy!!I purchased this set last July. I had a Kenmore that still worked perfect for over 10 years. My husband just thought I needed an upgrade with all the new technology,NOT. This washer is for show only,it does not clean well at all. I put my daughters clothes in from school with dirt,food stain,etc and it comes out the washer with the same stain. My husbands uniforms comes out with the same deodorant stains as when i put them in . I kept the washer thinking ok,it will get better,but not. If you wash white clothes on Bright White,hot water and add enough bleach,for the most part those stains are mostly out,not all. If its unbalanced,which happened alot.. the cycle wont finish or rinse,so after 1hr already of washing you go back thinking the clothes are done and its just sitting there. The only upside to this washer is that the bowl is huge,King size comforters etc fit great and the washer is quite. I will give that a 5..Everything else would be rated a 2. The sink is there for that reason,you have to scrub your stained clothes in the sink before washing. We paid over $1400 for the set when all was done. I couldnt take anymore of the clothes not coming out clean,they smelled just ok. I wish I'd taken pictures to show its not exaggeration.. I sold this set,I really prefer a washer with an agitator. I purchased the Maytag 4.7 with agitator. I hope its better. I will definately post my review of the Maytag after a couple of uses."
5.0,"""5'6"" and taller only""","If you are shorter than 5'6"", you'll need a stool or a grabber of some sort to get the clothes out of it. I have to stand on my tippy toes. It's quiet and efficient and I love it!"
