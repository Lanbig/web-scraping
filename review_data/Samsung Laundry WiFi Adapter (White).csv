2.0,"""Useless""","We bought a pair of these to connect our washer and dryer to the smart home we are doing. They are only connected to the internet when the washer and dryer are on, so don't expect to fluff your clothes or run a refresh on your way home from work.  Literally the only thing they do is tell you when the cycles are done. (You can start a cycle, but you are already standing at the machine because you had to turn it on)"
1.0,"""Not really happy about this product""","I purchased 2 of these the one I put on my dryer took a while to set up, but after many tries its on my phone and it works, the one I purchased for my washing machine will not work, I have tried and tried and it just wont work. I wish now I would have just purchased one. once you have it installed its kind of neat to monitor the cycles etc."
1.0,"""Awful Product""","Absolutely awful experience with my Samsung washer & dryer. Both were suppose to be able to connect to the smart home app by purchasing this accessory in order to receive laundry notifications and remotely control the appliances. Neither worked well after a week of experimenting.  The washer and dryer go ""offline"" when they are not turned on, so you cannot remotely control the appliances as you have to be standing next to them to turn them on first. After this issue, I thought I would just use the app for notifications when my laundry was finished. That didn't work either. The cycle would end and the appliance would go offline, resulting in lost connectivity, before the app could send a notification."
5.0,"""Great Purchase""",Loaded with features and easy applications. Never bought a Samsung product and was disappointed. Super value and quality.
5.0,"""Great Helper""",I love being able to see how far along my washing cycle has to go and also if there is a problem it will tell you. LOVE IT!!!
3.0,"""Great idea - poor implementation""","The idea is great. Unfortunately the way they did it was really poor: 1. Why do you need to buy it separately? Why not to have it built-in?2. Once you connected the app to your appliance you have to manually push a button for it to work. Why? If I am already in front of my washer/dryer - why would I use the app? I would use the buttons on the appliance, which is more convenient. Anyway, even if you decide to use the app, you need to wait for 1-2 minutes for the connection to be established, which is another reason not to use the app. And even after you wasted your precious 1-2 minutes, once you hit ""RUN"" button the app becomes useless as you can no longer control anything, just be a watcher3. The app is JUST HORRIBLE! Will not work on the cellular connection, only on your home Wi-Fi. The whole idea of being in control is gone. Use you the app while you are at home, probably 10 feet away from your appliance. Adding appliances is another mess. I added a washer and a dryer and the dryer would always be added as a Washer 2. I tried everything, chose different types of dryers (even if it was not mine) and still the same - Washer 2. OK, you can re-name it. I renamed it and it was showing as a Dryer. But once you go inside the app it is still showing as a Washer 2. And a lot more to complain. But these are the most unpleasing facts"
5.0,"""great features""",Price great also very happy with this product and other Samsung products that we have
1.0,"""Smart Home app makes this useless""","These seem to work as they should, they connect to the router. However, we don't get the benefit of having these because the Samsung Smart Home app is absolutely terrible. At first I was getting notifications when my loads were done but I'd have to make sure to open the Samsung app on my phone or I'd never get a notification. Now, it only tells me when a door is open or something and never when a load is done nor does it tell me how much time is left anymore. Samsung needs to work on their Smart Home app so that these adapters actually do their job!!"
2.0,"""ALWAYS DISCONNECTS""","I jave a wifi booster and it still disconnects all the time,,,not consistent"
3.0,"""Very limited functionality""","Doesn't offer much control. Set up directions are poor. Notifications do not produce sound only screen notice. All in all, not impressed"
5.0,"""So far so good""",This is my second washer like this. One in a rental property. Like the new updates. Add a door is cool.
2.0,"""Very hard to setup - still trying to make my washer smart""",I'm following the instructions exactly with no luck. The wifi connection between my washer and AP keeps failing. They are less than 10 yards apart. Not easy at all.
4.0,"""is great and works perfect.""","It connected, easy and works perfect. You need to have a good wifi,  The app works good with my smart things app butNeeds connectivity with echo Alexa. I receive push notifications on my phone windows 10 well."
2.0,"""sounds better than it is.""","Sounded like a very good product and idea. Load washer before I leave for work, then start the wash on the way home from work, and wash will be done when I get home. Don't bet the house on it . Very, very, very poor instructions for setting up, registering, and controlling units."
5.0,"""First time front load user""","This is the first time I've used a front load washer. I find this washer gets my clothes much cleaner. Always loved Samsung products and wanted to try a front loader. My sister convinced me they get clothes cleaner. She's right! Love the ""add laundry door""!"
5.0,"""Smart adapter""",Works great. A little pricey for features. Doesn't work while dryer is off.
1.0,"""Can't get it to work""","I just received my adapters for my 7500 series washer and dryer. I cannot get them to work, and do not know where to go for assistance. The appliances are great. The adapter is poor. I have numerous Samsung products that I love."
1.0,"""Poor Wi-Fi Range""","Keep getting message on App saying Wi-Fi router is too far away. Router was in basement right under washer & dryer, Moved router to room right next to laundry room, worked when first hooked up, then message reappeared. Whole house runs off of this Wi-Fi without problems. Have garage door hooked up which is away from the house and it works great,"
1.0,"""Not Included with Appliance""","When I purchased my washing machine, I did not read the fine print that the adapter had to be purchased separately. Huge disappointment. I've already paid for this feature when I bought the machine and it is totally useless now. With such poor reviews (Here and elsewhere), I will not be purchasing the adapter. This should be included with the appliance since it is required by the feature."
5.0,"""Great Buy!""",This product not only looks amazing its performance is outstanding. I could not be happier. The only added bonus would be a light for the inside. Thanks Samsung you hit another one out of the park!
3.0,"""Fantastic idea, poor execution""","I bought two of these for my 6200 series washer/dryer. The physical install was straightforward and easy to figure out. The software setup/config is not as easy/useful as it could be.1) If you want to set the devices up for two different phones, you must do the setup for each device two times.2) At least on my series washer/dryer, you must push and hold the button to turn on the wifi adapter, they don't turn on automatically3) The iPhone app is OK in some parts, slow and buggy in othersa) Controlling the device seems to work OK (Setting the type, reminders, ect)b) I don't always get notifications when the cycles on either device is complete. I normally get notifications if I have the reminder turned Onc) Every time I open the app it says that I have been disconnected and then it needs to reconnect, sometimes taking multiple tries4) My washer randomly needed to be re-set up for wifi connectivity. Not sure if this was because the button to turn the wifi on is the same to set up the wifi, but that was annoying because it had to be re-set up for both phones again If I had the chance to buy it again, I'm not sure if I would or not. Some of the pains might be worth the notifications if you do a lot of laundry."
2.0,"""Won't stay connected to wifi""","I can get it to connect to WIFI, and I can start a load in the washer or dryer, but then when I go back to check on the status, it has disconnected again. During the cycle, it will SOMETIMES reconnect and allow me to see the status, but then just minutes later it is gone again. The Smart Home app interface needs to be a little easier to use during setup. Interface is ok after setup, if it stays connected.I have not tried moving my router closer to the laundry room, but all other WIFI devices work fine throughout the house and this is closer than most of them. If moving it closer helps, I will come back and update my review. My suggestion is to build the WIFI into the washer/dryer in future models so that you can get a better WIFI radio into it. This adapter just doesn't live up to the quality level of what I would normally expect from a Samsung product. The washer and dryer are awesome products, I just wish this adapter was the same."
