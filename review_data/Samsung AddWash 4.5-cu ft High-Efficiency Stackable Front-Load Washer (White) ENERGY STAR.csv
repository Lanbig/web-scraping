5.0,"""Quiet and Quick..""",Just bought this and have done at least 7 loads of laundry and everyone of them washed great..love the extra spin cycle button for the large loads..came out so dry..and the little door worked great ..I used it when I forgot to put the dogs blankie in and it worked great.....got it on sale and it was well worth the money...the machine is super quiet ..you will love it if you get one..
2.0,"""Samsung Add a Door Model Leaks""","Unfortunately this new model is not as reliable as the other Samsung models.  I purchased this model for the ""add a door"" feature and it leaked from the bottom of the washer the first wash.  It was exchanged for the same model and the second one started to leak after the third wash.  I have other Samsung's washers in other house's and they work great.  New model requires a tub to protect your house from water leaks."
5.0,"""Great Machine""",Have had this machine over a month now. I just ran the first self clean on it; starts blinking at 40 loads. Very happy with performance so far. It does a very effective job at cleaning the clothes very quietly.
4.0,"""Specs wrong. Does not have reversible door.""",Specs on this page are wrong.  This unit along with the white version states has reversible door...and this blue and the white model do NOT have a reversible door.
1.0,"""D.O.A.""","I would love to say something positive about this washer, however, the first one we received wouldn't even power up.  Great quality control from Samsung.  Thankfully, I purchased it from Lowes so they immediately took it back and replaced it with another washer.  If you do buy this machine, I would highly recommend purchasing the extended warranty."
3.0,"""does well but extended service a joke""","I am on my second unit. first unit worked almost 5 years before drum seal and bearings failed. Still under extended warrantee. The companies Lowes contracts for repair will cancel service calls or change times without contacting customer. Samsung will not allow bearing and seal change- must change complete drum, which is expensive and not authorized. After 6 weeks of paying $2 per load at laundromat and several repair companies, Lowes replaced unit with a new one. This lasted 3 weeks before sounding like a jet engine taking off when spinning. Now back to the same run around with repair companies."
1.0,"""Run Forest Run""","Most of these product reviews are short term so let me give you a long term test review.  Like the title says, RUN FAR RUN FAST.  My wife and I purchased the matching pair, washer and dryer, on our way home from closing on our house, August 31, 2012 and had them delivered and installed by Lowe's the following day.  In 2014, we noticed the washer start making noises in 6 months it destroyed itself by vibrating so bad you could feel it in the concrete floor of the house.  Yep, had the service tech come look at it and the parts to repair it cost more than a new washer.  The washer didn't last 3 years.  Thinking it was just a bad washer, I replaced it with another Samsung to keep a matching set, biggest mistake ever.  Here we are just over 4 years and the dryer quit drying 2 months ago and as soon as I can afford to replace it, I plan to with anything but Samsung.  Contacted Samsung about these and their response was tough, it's out of warranty, pay to fix it.  Run from anything with Samsung's name on it.  For what I paid these should have lasted at least 12 years or more.  Not less than 3."
1.0,"""Worst Customer Service Ever!!!!!""","I was so excited when I ordered this. However, the first time I used it, it made a terrible rattle noise and shook really bad when it would spin. I have called Samsung and they sent  a great, local guy who said that the whole drum would have to be replaced. It requires the whole thing to be taken apart. I thought this was ridiculous and asked for a new unit(the repair guy even suggested it). They refused and sent someone else who said the same thing. They now want to send a third repair man and I am about to lose my mind! It's now been a month that I am without my new washing machine and I am getting NO WHERE with Samsung. An executive even told me that that is their process and we can't always have it our way. Never again will I buy ANYTHING made by Samsung. Run AWAY!"
2.0,"""Samsung needs to do better""",I have had this machine for a week yes it gets the clothes clean but is as noisy as a train wreck at certain cykles. It shakes and vibrates terrible.  I have it upstairs near my kitchen and dining room.  This machine is unexepted in my home.  I have returned to Lowes and buying an LG front loader.  Hope I have better luck.
5.0,"""Great Machine.""",This machine is great.  It is so quiet and washes great.  I like the addwash feature as it lets you add something that you forget to put in with your load.  It holds a lot and you do less loads due to the size.
1.0,"""Junk""","Parts exploded inside after 6 years replacement parts if available would be way more than the original cost of the washer. Leaked out the front since the day I bought it, repair tech said it was just out of level, phooey. Not worth buying"
1.0,"""Stopped Working in 2 weeks""",I bought this washer after the recall on the Samsung Top Loader machine.  I found the barrel to be very small compared to my top loader and any button on a pair of pants would hit the glass on the front of the door which made for a loud clicking sound.  The washer itself stopped working after 2 weeks and maybe about 10 loads completed.  I will not be buying another Samsung washer again.
1.0,"""Question for owners""","I bought this washer 3 days ago and still can't use it. Now it was a return but I was told it was only a scratch and dent nothing else wrong. So I bought the set. They delivered it the next day but we hooked it up because the employee didn't. After we tried to use it it leaked all over from the bottom or the washer, the next day they fixed that problem and now when it does to spin/drain it's saying 4C and they can't come out for 2 weeks to fix it. I need clean cloths so I was wondering if anyone else has had this problem with this washer? I'm so unhappy with this set I just might return it and get a different on, I also got the 5year warranty. Someone please help!!!!!!!!"
1.0,"""Worst machine ever.""","Worst machine ever.  My brand new machine did not from the first time I used and Lowes or Samsung does not want to fix or exchange the machine.  Once it is out of their store, they are not responsible for anything!"
1.0,"""Buy any other washer/dryer""","There isn't a true gentle cycle on this machine. It creates a knot of clothes that has to be untangled after every wash. The wrinkles that the knots create do not come out in the dryer. This washer has torn apart 4 of my shirts. There is no pre-soak option and the quick wash cycle is 35 minutes. I regret buying this machine with every wash. Do yourself a favor and buy any other washer.When this machine breaks (which according to reviews on other sites, will be 18 months after purchase) I will not be getting another samsung and I will not be going back to lowe's."
1.0,"""Very Disappointed""","I purchased this washer in January due to a sale but deferred deliver and installation until 4 weeks ago.  In the 4 weeks of use, I cannot give this washer a positive review.  In comparison, I had another brand for 5 years but left it with the home we sold and moved from.  It was super quiet and trouble free.  I chose the Samsung due to the high number of positive reviews and the price was really good at less than $700.  This washer vibrates so badly on the spin cycle that anything sitting on top of it falls off during the spin cycle.  It is also very noisy due to the sides flexing in and out so badly creating a resonating sound.    This washer also smells since day one.  I thought it was just the new smell of the rubber seals, etc., but its not going away.  I do leave the detergent drawer completely out and the door ajar but it still smells. I've tried to give it time to see if I can learn to like it but its just not happening.  Its either defective or just a poor machine.  I would love for Lowes to replace the washer with a new one or give me a refund.  Thanks."
1.0,"""Horrible!!""","DO NOT buy a Samsung appliance.  My washer is less than a year old and they have sent a repairman to my house 6 times in the past month to work on it and its still not fixed! They refuse to replace it!! Their customer service is horrible! They are rude and unhelpful.  Wish I could say Lowe's customer service was anymore helpful, but after being on the phone for an hour and a half, all they did was put in a complaint with Samsung."
1.0,"""Don't Buy This Model""",I purchased this particular washing machine model due to it having the door in the front to add in an item that I may have forgotten before starting the wash cycle.  The machine worked for almost a month 28 days to be exact.  I kept getting the 4C error message which means there was a problem with the draining.  I never had any draining problems with my previous washing machine. The message could not be cleared no matter what I did.  I stopped the  machine and re-started it.  I put it on a different cycle and tried again.  Nothing worked so I called for service.  There is only one repairman in my area there fore it was going to take a week before someone could come to repair the problem under the warranty that I purchased.  Due to the problem occuring within 30 days of the purchase date I decided to just return the product.  I thought I must have got a lemon but read through these reviews and see that someone else had described the exact same error message problem.  I ended up returning this machine for the lower end model WF45M5500AZ.  Hoping I won't have any issues with this one!  I had this particular model in the past and it lasted a fairly long time however the front of the machine below the door became very rusted.  I recommend wiping down the inside of the door between uses.  Hoping they fixed the rusting issue over the years.  I'm sure it must have happened to someone else in the past.  Praying to God I don't have any more washing machine issues.
5.0,"""""We love this washer""""","We love our new machine! I love the many options. My machines were delivered last Monday and I have been washing practically everything. So far I have used all 12 setting options, and all works great! I was looking everything underneath for the last 2 days for leaks, so happy to report that so far there's none. Love love it! I would like to add also that the 2 guys from Lowe's were super nice people...We are very happy with the whole experience!"
5.0,"""Great washer - Laundry room has issues""","We purchased this washer because of the good reviews, energy saving, utility rebate (and the old one died)The door on this washer is tinted (as shown in the picture)  It is so quiet that we had no way to tell if it was working or not, with the TV on the next room.The light in our laundry room is centered over the washer and dryer (perfect for top load washer).  Unfortunately it puts the panel of this washer in the shadows, making it hard to read.  A new light will take care of that.The WI-FI interface is $25 direct from Samsung.  Why the heck don't they include it, at that price?"
2.0,"""Must be 7 feet tall to use the stackable""","Considered this front load washer and dryer because of color and stackable.  After stacking  instulation, I saw that you must be more than my height of 5 ft 7 "" to read the controls on the top unit.  The controls on both units are tilted back.    Poor poor design. Choices: unstack the units or stand on a stool to set the dryer."
1.0,"""Terrible investment - DON'T BUY SAMSUNG WASHERS""","We bought this washer with the matching dryer eight years ago.  After a couple years, we had to pay about $250 to have a new water pump installed.  The last straw was when the unit flooded our laundry room.  At this price point, a washer should hold up for more than eight years!  On a related note, I've had to replace the heating element in the dryer TWICE in the 8-year period, and the dryer died today.  I can't afford a new washer and dryer every 8 years.  I'm done with Samsung appliances!"
1.0,"""Worst machine ever.""",This washing machine did not work from the 1st day of its use.  Samsung doesn't want to replace it or fix it!  Samsung has the worst customer service ever!
1.0,"""Did not work""","Helped my customer pick this machine. It is delivered to the house. Hook it up and nothing. The door locks, but the unlocks. Called Samsung customer service and was told she wanted to speak with a professional, not with me. I informed her I was more than able to read, and was calling to inquire as to the error code of ""C6"". After repeating the steps that had been done previously, she informed me there was something wrong with the machine, and informed me how lucky I was to have bought it from Lowes, because they now have to fix the problem.I will never recommend another LG product to anyone."

5.0,"""This product cleans clothes fabulously""",I never had a front load washer before but I love my new Samsung. The clothes seem to come out cleaner and drier. I keep looking for more things to wash!
2.0,"""Over Rated""","I decided to purchase it due to high consumer rating to replace my old top loading washer that lasted 21 years. However, I had but bad experience with the horrendous shaking and noise at the beginning of the spin cycles despite the unit being level. The retailer provided a replacement which was not much better. It is still below my expectation in terms of being quiet and smooth operation. I will keep this for a few weeks and I may return it for a refund. If anyone wants to know, it is made in China."

5.0,"""Great Washing Machine""","It took several days of researching for a washer and after much investigation on different forums and purchasing sites regarding customer experience I decided on Samsung.

4.0,"""Great value for features""","I like the fact that you can operate the machine through a smart device like your phone since it is marketed as a ""smart"" machine. I have to give it a thumbs down for having to buy an adapter which is an additional cost. If the machine is a smart machine it should come out of the box ready to operate."

5.0,"""So far it has been a great washer.""","I just purchased this washer yesterday and so far it has been great. Very easy to set and program. I love the hidden tray where you add detergent and softener. The only bad thing I have to say about it is that it's awfully low to the ground, thus almost forcing you to buy the pedestal to use it."

4.0,"""So far, so good, but don't buy this for the Smart Home feature""","The washer was a great deal, I got it under my rebate program to replace my top-load. So, this washer was an upgrade. I bought the option Smart Home module. Don't. It is only enable if you press the ""Smart Connect"" button, and hold for 5 seconds, then wait 10-15 seconds for it to connect to WiFi. The button must be pressed after each load is added. This means, if you want to be notified when the wash is over, you must press it after loading the load, and before starting the load. If you forget, you cannot connect to it. The wifi does not stay on, so the built-in energy consumption report is inaccessible unless you physically walk over to your washer, and turn on the wifi. (note, turning on the wifi locks the door closed).As a Smart Home connected washer, it's not. As a 12 cycle front load washer, this seems like a good deal.

5.0,"""ALMOST GAVE UP ON FRONTLOADING WASHERS""",LOVE THIS WASHER - MUCH IMPROVED OVER OUT LAST FRONT LOADER.
5.0,"""Always a happy customer""","We always choose samsung for any electronic we have in our home. When it was time to buy a new washer and dryer, choosing Samsung was a no brainer. Our set is stylish and sleek and has gone beyond our expectations. I love the song it sings when our laundry is complete, its refreshing for a family of 7 to hear something than the old buzzing sounds. From sports uniforms to blouses I can trust my washer has it handled.. It is very easy to work. I was a little iffy on reviews of an odor from the washer, however we have not had any at all and we do a ton of laundry! Well done Samsung!"
3.0,"""Not happy about purchase""","I purchased this new washer about two weeks ago, since my other Samsung washer was recalled. This new washer seems to retain some old dirty water after each wash. When it sits for a day or two and the door is opened, a foul smell comes from inside the drum area. If it continues , I will call out samsung repair to look into the problem."
5.0,"""New to Front Loader... but LOVING IT!!!""","My 10 yr old top load washer went out and I decided to purchase this product as I felt the #1 feature of a top loader was to add clothes during the wash cycle. This AddWash feature meets that need. Not to mention that the unit is so quiet.  If you are new to front load machines, keep in mind that they do NOT use much water so be not afraid that the unit does not fill up with water!"
5.0,"""Great investment""",I've had this product for two months now and it has done a great job.
5.0,"""Most Wonderful Washer""","I am so happy with this washer. I love the HE, I love the ADD item, I love the song - everything about this washer is wonderful. Also practical, this washer is so large I no longer need to go to the laundry mat for large items."
5.0,"""Samsung Dryer""",I love the fact that it is so quiet. So many options and a usb connection to add an app is very nice. Just wish the notification sound could be adjusted. Sometimes it's too quiet
5.0,"""Awesome first week with new washer""",This washer replaced an old machine that was chronically breaking down (not Samsung). I was excited to get this new washer and was a great value for the money. I have washed extra-large bedding and delicate-wash items and they have all come out very well.
5.0,"""Great washer""","Very quiet and efficient, very fast quick wash cycle. Love it!"

5.0,"""Samsung washing""",Still learning... Love the design and features. Cleans clothes great. Can smell funny if water sits unattended.
4.0,"""GREAT..""","LONG CYCLES THOUGH, seems to wash very effectively and thorough. Love the look and the versatility!!"
5.0,"""So Far So Good""","Our washer, after 30 years finally gave out. The stress of buying a new washer is never fun. I wanted something of quality, something that will last, something that's in our budget, and that will make doing laundry easier for my family. This machine is so cool . It sounds like a glider taking off. It is quiet and cleans clothes so well. The spin cycle gets so much water out, that my dryer does its job in half the time, saving on energy. I also like that it plays a small classical tune after the load is finished washing (you can opt to turn this off). I'm excited to continue to explore all the other options."
5.0,"""I love this washer! Great features!""","We purchased this washer when my old one went out. This has a lot of features that my old washer didn't have... and now that I have them, I don't want to go back. The ability to add a forgotten item to the wash during the wash cycle is priceless... and I have often used the ""quick wash"" cycle to wash material before I sew. It sets the temperature automatically ... you just set the control for what you put in... towels, sheets, perma-press, whites. My husband likes the little tune that it plays at the end of the cycle. I also think that it does a better job of washing than my last machine did. The only problem that we originally encountered was that it was larger than our old machine. Since we bought a matching dryer, we ended up moving things around a bit but it worked. Another nice feature is that It is so quiet. My old machine used to sound like a jet taking off. I really love this machine! You'll enjoy this washer."
5.0,"""The product is great!""",Best new appliances I have ever bought. RECOMMENDED
5.0,"""Great Machine""","I am very well pleased with my new washing machine. It cleans clothes very clean the first time. I really like the tray for detergent, fabric softener and bleach. The add things to the wash door is a very nice feature as well."
5.0,"""So happy we bought this washer!""","We decided to replace our washer and dryer after the pair we had needed several repairs. They were 10 years old. As you can imagine a lot has changed with the options!!We've had the new washer and dryer for 6 weeks now, so glad we bought new ones! We definitely noticed a big difference in efficiency and fresh laundry! Only drawback....The size is a bit bigger than I was expecting, by the doors being rounded more than our previous pair. We ended up removing our laundry room panel doors. Still love it though!"
5.0,"""Great washer""","We have had this for a few days and it works excellent. We bought the set b/c of the positive reviews that these units had and the lack of negative reviews. I'm sure little things will come up in the future, like with all things, but we are 100% satisfied. Highly recommend!! The connect feature is also fun to play with."

4.0,"""Inlove with this washer""",So far i have had the Addwash laundry washer for less than a month but i am so in love with it. The 4.5 cft capacity is awesome. i can wash al off my bedding in one load and make sure it is clean. I have already noticed my water bill and energy bill drop with the efficiency of it. I can not wait until i save up to buy the matching dryer to go with it.

4.0,"""Looks and operates good""","It looks really nice, and does what it is supposed to do... wash clothes. A tad bit noisy but not too bad. I give it a total of 4 stars!"
4.0,"""So Far So Good""",I have just purchased this machine for my wife and of course I had to use it first while she was a work and I must say I am more than impressed with the ease of setup and the very clear instructions on how to wash and what settings so on and so on. Basically idiot proof. The overall experience so far is amazing. VERY quiet in all cycles of the wash no matter the load capacity or not. The fact that there is filters that you can clean (every 2 months) and the unit has a self cleaning mode is all the better to purchase the unit. Nothing says clean like sanitation!
4.0,"""So far, so good, but don't buy this for the Smart Home feature""","The washer was a great deal, I got it under my rebate program to replace my top-load. So, this washer was an upgrade.

(note, turning on the wifi locks the door closed).As a Smart Home connected washer, it's not. As a 12 cycle front load washer, this seems like a good deal.

The Add an Item Through the door Feature is Important Because you almost always find a sock or article which fell somewhere between the Hamper and the front door of the Machine while you were loading and what a neat feature because of the door locking.

1.0,"""Run from his brand""","We purchased this Samsung washing machine 6 months ago. At first it was ok, then stopped draining. We have been without a washing machine thanks to Samsung for the last two weeks! Their customer service sucks and you can never get a straight answer from anyone there. We were told someone was coming out to fix it, to getting a new washer, finally to be told we were getting a refund. The best part is, when you go buy a new washing machine because they will not replace it, you are unable to send it back because of the info they need from the washer. Be very cautious about purchasing a product from Samsung. I would give this zero stars if it were an option."
1.0,"""Poor customer service!""","I have had this washer less than a year and it has already broken and torn 2 pieces of clothing. It ripped holes in a pair of Chico's pants and a shirt.Then the washer would not spin.  I called Samsung and they sent out a repairman who told me that Samsung said my clothes were old (they were not) and that I spun them to fast.  I told them I washed then on the permanent press cycle on low spin speed. The repairman ordered a part that would fix the problem with the machine not spinning.  I then called Samsung myself and asked them what they were going to do about my clothes being torn and they said I should wait and see if it happens again after it is repaired and then they told me I should wash it on delicate.  The only spin cycle lower than low is ""no spin"". I asked to speak to a supervisor and no one would speak with me.  They said they would send the information to ""upper management"".Obviously I have to have the machine tear up another piece of clothing before they will consider doing anything about it."

The one hiccup that I had was the doors and installation. The technition told me that the doors were not reversible, which would have made it  extremely awarkard to transfer the loads from washer to dryer. They ended up  Extending the hose for the dryer vent and putting the dryer in front of the washer hook up and the the washer hoses reached to the dryers spot. It worked. No problems so far. The  technician also told us that they would not fit under our shelves with the pedestals. I measured after they left and they clearly did fit. Unfortunately, my husband and I had to lift the washer and dryer on the pedestal our selves. I was not happy about that!"

The capacity is amazing by comparison to our previous washer. We're a household of 11 so we do loads and loads of laundry. This washer has helped dramatically with the process. It is also quite smooth operating and quiet. Only minor complaint I have is that I can't switch the way the door opens with this model. Also, with the matching dryer stacked on top the combo was too big for my laundry closet. Obviously, I didn't measure ahead of time. No worries though, I'll be correcting this soon, bringing the doorway of the closet out to allow the closet doors to close. Always something right ;-)"

5.0,"""Excellent Product""","I just purchased this washer to replace my other top load, and so far is superb. Really quiet on the cycles and has more capacity than my previous one. I'm thinking about stacking it with the matching dryer in the future."
5.0,"""LoveSC""",Love how it cleans the cloths.... the only con is that it takes a long time over an hour for the wash cycle but it spins the cloths out so much that the dryer cycle time is slower so that is good.
1.0,"""Stopped working after 4 months""","My washing machine is only 4 months old and has already stopped working. It worked perfectly for the last 4 months with no issues, but decided to completely break on Friday. The washer will not power on and I am waiting for a service technician to call me to set up an appointment. VERY unhappy with this and would NOT recommend to anyone. Luckily, I am still under warranty, but very upset that my family of 4 will have to make a trip to the laundromat to wash our clothing. For the price and age of the washer, this is completely unacceptable."
5.0,"""I am in love with this washer!""","I swore I would never own a front load washer, and then I saw this... I loved that it did not have that laundromat look and with the AddWash door, I was sold! With 3 teens you know there is ALWAYS something that should have gone in the load, and it has been utilized A LOT since I purchased it on 11/12. I am overjoyed with how well it cleans and how quickly it does it. After making the switch from an older model top load to a new Samsung HE machine, I will never go back - I have never enjoyed doing laundry so much!"
5.0,"""Love this machine""","I bought this machine for three reasons: The add in door, the large capacity and the price. So far I have been completely satisfied. I am able to do laundry in half the time as it took in my old machine and the clothes seem cleaner. The ""normal"" cycle takes less than an hour and leaves clothes very clean. The spin cycle is so effective that even my drying time is less! Highly recommend this machine."
2.0,"""Samsung Washers""","I am on my third Samsung Washer in a little over seven years. The spider bracket on the back of the tub after four or five years just disintegrates, and the top loader I had blows itself up on high spin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love that I can add a piece of laundry through the door. This is my first front load washing machine. The spin cycle removes much of the water which means less time in the dryer.

They look amazing and perform even better. They are so quiet during the entire cycle! I couldn't believe it. My old washer sounded like a jet preparing for takeoff. There are so many cycles to choose from . . . And the matching dryer has the steam feature .....NO MORE IRONING FOR ME, If you are struggling trying to decide.....don't hesitate buying the Samsung product....you won't be sorry!"

5.0,"""After 3 weeks""","So far I have liked this washer. I have done several loads of bedding, whites, & jeans. All have been cleaned very well. I have used and liked having the add wash feature.This washer is great for large loads.

5.0,"""Great washer""",Bought this one to replace my 8 year old samsung washer that worked great but we finally killed it 2 loads a day 5 days a week. This washer spins way faster than the old front load we had hope it lasts just as long.
4.0,"""Wasn't expecting to purchase a Samsung""","My old washer unexpectedly bit the dust so I was not really sure what I wanted in a new one. I've only ever had a top load model with an agitator, so I called a couple family members who had front load models to get their opinion but still didn't know what I wanted when I went shopping. The gentleman in the store pointed me to the Samsung models, stating that they were most definitely the best sellers & top of the line. He has one (top load model) that he's very pleased with. I will have to say that surprised me as I had anticipated purchasing a different brand. I hope he knows what he's talking about! I've only had this machine for about 2 weeks and so far, I like it. I wanted the white model but it wasn't in stock & chances are it will be months before it was available and we needed something immediately. To be honest, I thought I'd purchased the steam model, but soon enough found out that was not true. I'm not sure how much I'd have used that anyway, but I'm kind of sad I'm not going to get to try it. Hopefully it will be a good long time before I need to purchase another one!!Pros: the blue color is rather attractive, although as mentioned, I wanted white & it really doesn't match the room it's in. The controls are easy to use. There's a ""cheat sheet"" for the error codes. I like that I know exactly how long a load will take. It seems to clean our clothes well, but the real test will be in the summer when the baseball clothes full of grass stains & sand get put thru it. I like the Add a Door a lot & am very glad I have that feature since it's a front load. I like the tray where the laundry products are added as it's convenient & easy. The machine itself is pretty quiet. I like that I can set a clothes basket on top since it's a front load. It uses very little water (which I guess is good??). I don't see as much lint as in my dryer vent, which is a result of the non-agitator. This machine doesn't ""beat up"" your clothes as much as the agitator versions.Cons: it's blue, which cost me more, which was annoying, especially since I wanted the white. It seems like a load of laundry takes longer than in my old machine, but that could just be perception, since I can see that up front & with my old one, I had no idea. I don't like that the ""Towel"" load type doesn't allow hot water, so I haven't actually used that setting yet. I did a load of sheets that really seemed to be balled up when they came out so it concerns me that they possibly aren't as clean as they could be. It may be how they were loaded. It's something I'll be keeping an eye on. I have to keep the door cracked after my last load to let the water around the seal dry up so it doesn't stink. I was aware of this prior & it's not a big deal for me. The good news is that door stays where you leave it, it hasn't tried to open further or close so I hope that doesn't change. I'm concerned about the matching blue dryer being discontinued before I need it. I've been waiting for my dryer to die for a couple years now. :-) Also, I do not have the matching pedestal. I'd like it, but it rather pricey & I'm not even sure where you'd purchase it. My store did not have them. Overall, at this point I would recommend this machine and I'm hoping I can still say the same thing 15 years from now! (My original washer lasted 25+ years...)"

Seems to clean well (I'm picky about that) without being hard on the clothes. Love the add wash feature, as I always seem to find something that needs to go in after I start it. Sure, with my old front loader, I could pause it and open the door to add, but it would drain the water and inevitably still have some that would drip out on the floor. This is no mess, no fuss. The only down side I've found is that it seals so tight that if it is shut in between laundry days, it starts to get a smell. I just leave the door slightly open and it is fine. Also, love the color!"

We replaced our old front loaders with this dryer and washer set and it's like we're in the 21st century with regards to laundry. We purchased it 07/24/16 and post 1 month we have been so satisfied.

5.0,"""Still Works Great (After 3 Months)""","With a family of 5, I wash clothes daily to stay on top of the laundry. And so far, I've been completely satisfied with both the Washer and Dryer. Below are a few comments and attached photos that I hope are helpful.1. I really wanted stack-able units to maximize the use of space in my laundry room.  The stacked height of my units is 77.25in. The ceiling in my laundry room is 82.5in. As you can see in the photos, I have about 5in of clearance. The stacked unit provide easy access to the rear for cleaning out the Dryer vent when needed.  Before, I had the washer and dryer side-by-side and getting to rear of the machines was a pain.2. Washer: Has plenty of options, but I only use a few (Normal, Whites, Delicate, Bedding, Towels).  The clothes come out smelling very clean and fresh.  This machine washes a ALOT of clothes at once and definitely uses LESS water than my old Top Loader.  My water bill has decreased by $30!!!! The Normal washer setting finishes in about 59mins. There's a ""Quick Wash"" setting that takes about 30mins if needed. Some reviewers noted a bad ""mildew"" smell that starts to come from the Washer over time.  I took peoples advice to leave the door open after each use to allow drying.  I haven't had any problems with smells.3. Dryer: Also has plenty of features with a Wrinkle Release setting which is nice. Please note that this setting requires steam so there is a water line connection to the Dryer as well.  This is implemented using a ""Splitter"" off of the main Hot Water line. The ""Eco Dry Sensor"" setting works extremely well and the clothes have been dry at the completion of each cycle. This can take anywhere from 1-2 hours depending on the load size.  Please note that I have a very short run for the Dryer exhaust vent to the outside of my house.  This definitely helps with Dryer performance.WARNING: I had the ""Soft"" Dryer exhaust vent pipe on my older Dryer instead of the required ""Semi-Rigid"" vent exhaust vent pipe.  The ""Soft"" vent DOES NOT MEET CURRENT CODE and the Lowes Delivery Team WILL NOT install your machines with this setup due to Fire Hazards. I had to reschedule my delivery until I replaced the ""Soft"" vent with a ""Semi-Rigid"" or ""Rigid"" vent. I you look at the photos, you can see ""Soft"" vent that now connects to a ""Rigid"" vent. Please keep this in mind if you want Lowes installation."
