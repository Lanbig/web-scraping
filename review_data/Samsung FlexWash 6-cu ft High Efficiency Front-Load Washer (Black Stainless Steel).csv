5.0,"""Time Saver!""",Having a second washer for small loads of towels and/or delicate clothing is a huge time saver for my family. I love that I can wash 2 loads at the same time. The only negative is that it is a lot taller than it looked in the store so make sure you have enough space to open the top lid if you have cabinets above your washer/dryer.
2.0,"""Dripping Wet Open Door""","I had this brand new washer delivered and installed today.   So far I'm not that thrilled with it.  My old washer was a top loaded and was always getting unbalanced.  So I wanted to try a front loader this time and so I purchased this model.   This is my first front loader so I'm not sure if this is typical of all front loaders.   After the wash cycle finishes and I open the door, the door is dripping wet.  The water drips down onto my floor.  Never had to even think about this with my top loader.   Also the inside rubber lining that goes around the opening is also soaked, water pools in it.  I had to leave the door open to allow it to dry.  The washer can be a bit noisy during different times throughout the wash cycle.   Sometimes it makes a rattling noise.  Not sure if this is normal.  So far I hate having to bend down so low to get my clothes in and out of the washer.   I didn't order the pedestal because at only 6 inches tall I wasn't sure it would make much of a difference.  This washer looks a lot taller in my house then it did in the store. With the top washer lid open it just barely fits under my laundry room cabinets.  Had I bought the pedestal it would not have fit.   Also it would have been a little harder to work with the top washer.   I'm 5' 6"" and it's barely comfortable enough for me to reach over and put things in it."

5.0,"""The best washer ever""","I had one of the Samsung recalled top loaders, when I researched which new Samsung washer to replace it, all the other washers had horrible reviews. Being that at this point I was already disappointed with Samsung but knew my rebate required me to buy a new Samsung only washer I waited for this one to hit the market.  Well I had it delivered today and LOVE IT not only can you do 2 loads at once (delicate or small load and large load) but I find it uses way less water than my old top loader. And the time of a washer has been cut in half. I used to have to put my old top loader on the longest wash to ensure clean clothes. This washer does a better job with less water and less time. It's a bit exspensive but now that I have used it, would not hesitate to buy it."
3.0,"""Careful when you buy this!""",I just bought this thinking I could integrate it into my samsung smart home I have. I can't. Apparently samsung has different hubs you can buy and they don't both support the same devices. I have the smartthings hub that can do advanced automations. This machine is only supported on the Home Connect hub that really only lets you turn things on and off.
