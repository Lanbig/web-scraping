5.0,"""Love this washer!""","My front-loader dryer went out so I decided to purchase a new set of TOP-LOADERS!  I did a lot of research and this set I feel is the best bang for my buck.  I have had this washer for one week and thus far--it has been amazing.  It is quiet, cleans my clothes, large enough for blankets, etc AND I can still reach in and grab the clothes (I am 5""1').   I read other reviews saying it smells.....NO!  It smells new and my clothes come out perfectly clean."
5.0,"""Buy this set!!!""","We were hesitant to buy this set based on reviews that we read. The saleswoman at Lowe's explained that the previous model had recalls but the one we purchased about 2 weeks ago was a newer model and not part of the recall. That being said, the sale was too great to turn down, especially compared to some of the other brands that cost twice as much. I have done at least 15 loads of laundry so far and I can tell you this set is AMAZING!!! Both the washer and dryer are large enough to wash a king-sized comforter with no problem, not to mention that they are super quiet. If you are looking for a new washer and dryer & don't want to spend a small fortune, I highly recommend that you put this set at the top of your list. You won't be disappointed!!!!"
5.0,"""Samsung washer""","Really cant find anything I dont like about this machine. Its quite, easy to program, easy to see the controls, and cleans very well. Had originally bought a Maytag that was just way too loud for the location.This Samsung is quiet and spins even faster with less noise and vibration.As a bonus it is energy star as well. Hope it has the reliabilty... Lowes great return policy was important in my decision to buy there."
5.0,"""Top loader, no agitator""",Great washing machine.  Still getting used to it operation.  It is so much different then the old top load agitator type.  Holds plenty of clothes and they come out clean.  Have washed pillows and works great.  King size sheet set come out clean.
1.0,"""Leaking washer""","On the 2nd wash, used the Deep Wash cycle.  Water apparently leaked around an upper gasket somewhere above the drum.  Double checked supply and drain hoses - all dry.  Ran another wash with Deep Wash cycle - same thing - saw some water leak around right hand side upper seam - the rest came out the bottom.  Lowe's store was excellent to deal with - ended up returning the Samsung and bought a similar machine - Maytag.  The Samsung is not ready for prime time, yet."
3.0,"""Nice washer but wash times too long!""","Bought this washer a month ago based on reviews and sales price. Pros: large capacity, fairly quiet operation, energy efficient. Cons: no specific whites cycle and extremely long wash times!!! Ot is because of the washing time that I would not repurchase or recommend to a friend. Otherwise the price was reasonable and the clothes do get clean."
4.0,"""Good washing machine for the price""","This washer was purchased due to the recall on the prior model. My washing machine is in the garage in FL which is not ideal. I find the old washers & dryers to be better than the new ones. I have only done a couple loads of laundry so far and am happy with it. I just wish it filled with more water!  Overall, I am happy with it.  I purchased the same machine as I had only with the newer model, so I obviously must be happy overall. None are ideal with outdoor washers and dryers in FL heat!"
2.0,"""Not Worth it!!!""",The washer sticks CONSTANTLY on the spin cycle!!  Can take up to 5 hours to rinse and spin one load!  Will NEVER EVER buy another one!!  Wish I had my Maytag back!!
1.0,"""Leaks.  Cycles get stuck.  Noisy.""",Do not buy this machine or you will be sorry.  Had the first one replaced because of leaks.  Gets stuck on rinse and spin cycle.  Noisy.  I will never buy Samsung again.  Got a good price.  Lowes must be trying to get rid of them.  Spend a little extra.  It is not worth the headache.
5.0,"""a little deep but very nice washer""","I researched quite a few washers before settling on this one.  The tub is a little bit deep, I am 5'2"" and have to stand on tip toes to get everything in the bottom of the tub.  However it has a large capacity (which was important to me) and i CAN reach the bottom.  Some were small and I couldn't reach.  It works very quietly"
5.0,"""Great washer.""","Just delivered today. I have washed seven loads of various clothing and I'm very pleased with the results. The clothes are clean most of the water was spun out of the clothes,towels and sheets. I have read several reviews which has made me cautious. So far I am very pleased. I will post later on if anything changes."
5.0,"""Samsung Washer""","New electronic washer does the thinking for you.  It analysis the wash load and determines the washing time, amount of water to use, washer agitation etc."
3.0,"""had to replace  old one""",i like my old front loader better these use more water than front loaders its bigger than my old one i do the same amount with this one like my old one once a week and have had to take half of them out to do the spin cycle noisier to  only done to loads so far
1.0,"""Save your money""",Bought this washer a few months ago. Everything was great at first until it started taking forever for the rinse and spin cycle. It constantly resets itself when it starts to go uneven leaving the cycle to go on for HOURS UPON HOURS even after readjusting the load. Even tried to recalibrate the washer so it wouldn't go off balance all the time and no luck at all. Sure it has it's pros but the cons are what's making us throw this thing out and but a new washer.

2.0,"""worthless for very small loads""",samsung admits that the spin cycle on very small loads may not remove the water thus a manual spin needs to be added wasting time

1.0,"""WARNING DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!""","This washing machine has a recall from 2011-2016,check out youtube and reviews please.This washing machine( WILL EXPLODE)I bought this washing machine in 2013 from Lowes.It has been a problem from day one.Lowes and Samsung DO NOT care about their customers!!!!"
1.0,"""NOT IMPRESSED!""",I had a Maytag Bravos and had nothing but problems with it from day 1. It washed great but broke down 2-3 times a year. When it finally bit the dust I went to Lowes and bought the Samsung 4.5 on a friday! The following Wed 5 days later went back to Lowes to return it and buy a different one.  It did not do a good job washing the clothes clean.  It just swished them around a little.  The HE top loaders are supposed to rotate the clothes from the bottom to the top.  Never did this happen with this machine.  I am old school and if there are no bubbles its not clean.  With the HE detergents there are still bubbles but not a lot.  With the samsung never any bubbles which told me it was not agitating the clothes enough. The rinse cycle just spins the clothes to get the wash water out then sprays a jet of water into the clothes while still spinning and then the fabric softener sprays onto them while still spraying and spinning.  How is this getting all of the clothes rinsed and the softener into all of the clothes.  Its not!  Lowes was very accommodating in swapping out the Samsung for the LG I decided to try instead. In my opinion stay away from this washer.  Watch some you tube videos and make a wise decision before purchasing this washer.

5.0,"""Quality1shopper""","This is by far the most efficient washer that I have ever owned. It has a sleek design. The computerized control panel is easy to use. It is amazing that the washer has water level sensors that automatically calculate the size of the load, and the amount of water needed. It definitely is helping me to save on my water bill."
5.0,"""My first washer""","I quickly loaded my laundry to try my new washer from Samsung and I have to say am loving it. It has lot of features, bright display which I love and it is smart washer. I would def recommend it to my friends."
4.0,"""This washer is buy far one of the best ones.""",We looked at a couple of washers before we got this one. It was a lot of great things families would like. With all the newest features on the market today. The size of the drum that it has is a A++. No more going to the local laundry mat to do your big things to wash anymore with this washer. But on the downside it is a tad bit bigger then the other older washers out there. As of right now it is a very good washer for the price & fiction ability it can plus does. Weathering you go to buy or rent to our this is a great washer.

5.0,"""Samsung 4.5 Cu.ft High Efficiency Top Loader Washe""",The washer has lived up to expectations. Directions are easy to follow and the machine has performed very well and as expected. Only comment from the main operator is a wish that soap drawer be relocated.
5.0,"""Love it!""",So far so good. Will update if any issues or cons show up.
1.0,"""Terrible""","I hate this washer. After less than a year, it will not fill with hot water unless it is on the heavy duty cycle. It will not put enough water in the tub to properly wash the clothes. 1/2 of the clothes are never in the water during the wash cycle. It intermittently stops working, for no apparent reason. It is a terrible washer and I will never buy a Samsung appliance again."
2.0,"""very disappointed""",This washer senses the amount of water it will use based on the wash load but it does not detect the amount of clothing accurately from what I have experienced. your clothes basically swirls around in a puddle of water that does not cover the entire particles of clothing and therefore some of the clothes don't come clean or I should say parts of them. The only way to get enough water is to use the bedding or heavily soiled setting but then too much water is used and sometimes it overflows. I wish I could return it.
1.0,"""This product stinks""",The reason you don't see any reviews is because it has to be good or they won't post. Does not get enough water therefore does not clean your clothes. is Not Fast and easy takes 1hr 28min to wash sheets way to much electic and not enough water.
5.0,"""Satisfied with Samsung Top Loading Washer""",We had the 5.0 Top Loading Washer since 2013. No problems with that washer. It was recalled so we got the rebate and purchased the 4.5 Top Loading Washer.
5.0,"""Very Quiet Machine, has been great..""","After reading all the reviews on allot of models they all have their complaints as this one did. I went with Samsung because ourTV has been great.. I figured the recalls from 2016 were done with..The price was right too..This machine is very quiet and easy to use..Heavy duty loads do have long wash cycles..do the regular or quick wash. Spin cycle is also very quiet and efficient. Cleans clothes well..I really don't have any issues, happy with the purchase after 5 mos. now."
5.0,"""Great cleaning""",This is so much better than the last one and quiet [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
