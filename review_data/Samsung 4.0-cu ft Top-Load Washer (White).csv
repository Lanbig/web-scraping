5.0,"""Great Washer""","I had read the reviews and saw some people had a problem with the spin cycle and that their washer would just continue to rinse and spin over and over. So I made sure we did everything to avoid that and used the level on my iPhone. Well what do you know, we had that problem. Unlike people who let it run over and over, I just did the ""spin only"" cycle and shut the water off to the washer so it could not fill back up. My husband was not too happy we were having this problem, so he downloaded a ""bubble level app"" on his phone, and it showed that it was not level like we had initially thought. We had to raise the front up quite a bit and I have since done two more loads and PERFECT!One thing I really like about this, is just how easy it is to operate. I have used my moms and it will ""automatically"" fill according to weight, which I never know how accurate that can be, so I like that you can choose your load size.The only advice I have is for people to actually level it, or they will have problems, it takes less than a minute and will save you time and the pain of having a problem, and do NOT trust the level on the iPhone, it's not accurate enough."
3.0,"""Some issues at first, but not bad now...""","There is definitely a learning curve with this product, and many of the problems mentioned in reviews on other sites are a result of operator error, which I now know from my own experience...We had this washing machine delivered on 5/3/15 and ran our first load that night. We noticed that it took a fairly long time to finish, but apparently that is pretty typical of HE machines. I did another load the next day...but the cycle never stopped! It would spin to the point where it should be done and then fill back up with water over and over again; according to reviews on other sites, this is a very common complaint. After the fourth time it re-rinsed (over two hours later on the ""Quick Wash""), I powered the machine off in frustration and just threw everything in the dryer. I had not been using the HE detergent, so I thought maybe that was the cause of the problem. Tried the correct detergent the next day, but had the same issue. After SIX TIMES of the washer refilling, I shut it off again and decided to call it quits. Even when I would manually put it on the Spin cycle only, it would still fill with water. I went to Lowe's yesterday and told them I wanted to swap it out for something else, but the sales associate gave me some pointers and suggested giving it one more chance.Thanks to my conversation with the salesman and a fair amount of Internet research on the quirks of HE washers, I was able to figure out how to make this machine work correctly. First of all, HE detergent is a must (even though this particular washer only ""recommends"" it). Next, even though these HE machines do not have an agitator, you still have to treat them as if they do--position your laundry in a circle leaving a space in the center. I made the mistake of just dumping everything in there, but that will cause problems with the rinsing and spinning. Lesson learned. I also read that you should put heavier items on the bottom and lighter items on the top, but I did not do this and everything worked fine. Just something to keep in mind. Finally, make sure that it is properly balanced. If the drum is even slightly off, it messes with the sensors or something and the washer gets all confused (not to mention noisy). I used a bubble level to get mine just right. After doing these things, I was finally able to wash a load of clothes with zero issues. The Quick Wash took just over 35 minutes, which is good/average for an HE. When it started playing the song at the end of the cycle, I literally jumped for joy.All that being said, when the washer fuctions correctly, it seems to be a pretty good machine for the money. The clothes come out clean and fresh-smelling, and there is a ton of space in the drum, even after leaving an open circle in the middle. I love all the different options for water level and temp, and it's easy to use. I guess I need a little more time and experience to make a fair judgment, but so far so good."
1.0,"""Stay away from Samsung""","Stay away from SamsungPurchased a WA40J30000 series washer on 6/4/15. Washer didn't work from day one. I now entered the Samsung merry-go-round. I was told that under no circumstances would Samsung replace the washer or refund my money until their ""process"" was complete. That process involved 7 service calls and the replacement of every electronic component except the motor. The repairman finally gave up. On August 10, 2015 I received a refund check. 10 weeks without a washing machine.My issue is not that the machine didn't work. The issue is how Samsung handles the problem. This problem was identical to a service issue I had with a Samsung TV. The Samsung ""process"" insures the consumer will be inconvenienced as much as possible. Having spent 10 weeks without a washer and after spending hours on the phone and rearranging my schedule to have 7 service calls I can safely suggest it would be easier to wash your clothes over a rock on the river than buy a Samsung product."
5.0,"""Excellent Choice""","I have read reviews on this good and bad. I was a little afraid after purchasing that I would not be pleased. However, we set it up as instructed making sure it was level. Lowe's would have set it up for us and the delivery men were great, but we were not ready to install when they came. It works perfectly and is quite low noise. It does take a long time to spin out but the clothes come out much dryer after the spin than they did with my old washer. I prefer this to having to dry them a longer time. Much more energy efficient that way. I have completed 6 loads of wash so far and have only had it for 3 days but so far so good."
1.0,"""Problems from day one""","Machine #1 delivered, they made sure floor and machine was level, then made sure it ran and water was working and left. I proceeded to put a Quick Wash load in and went off to watch TV. I came back 1.5 hours later and it was just hitting the final spin. I left and came back to find it refilling with water so I waited there reading a magazine till it finished. When it was done I waited for the door to unlock but instead of unlocking it started to refill again at which point I hit pause and when it unlocked I took out the clothes and put in the dryer. Thus my nightmare began. No matter what cycle I used it always got hung in the final rinse, spin and I had to stand around and wait to manually stop it and remove clothes.I once put a quick load in and went to town and arrived back home 4 hours later to find it still running in the rinse spin cycle. SO SO UNHAPPY. I called Samsung because I know there is a learning curve with the new impeller top loaders. I was not impressed with their help because she was reading from a scripted message. She said it was a leveling issue and I told her it was not. The guys leveled the machine and I loaded all the loads the way the book said and used the recommended cycles but still the same thing. SO......I called Lowes and they cheerfully came and removed that machine and replaced it with a new one. (Same machine) Long story short it was the same issue. So I went to the store in person and talked to the appliance manager and the store manage and in the end I purchased a Samsung front loader and they came yesterday and picked up the #2 machine and installed the #3 front loader. I stayed with Samsung so it would at least half way match the new dryer we bought that matched the #1 washer. My husband wanted to NOT get another Samsung washer but I wanted to give them a chance. The new front loader works like a champ. I will review it in its place. I also found out that the day I returned #1 another customer returned that exact same machine with the exact same problem! So....... My final opinion on this machine is there is a defect somewhere and I would NEVER recommend it. However, I would also say don't judge Samsung on 1 machine.Koodos to Lowes for superior customer service because it took a numbers of calls and visits to finally get me a machine that I was happy with and never once did they make me feel like it was my fault!"
5.0,"""Great washer for the money""","When our previous washer (Maytag) died after only 6 yrs, We purchased the Samsung and have not had any of the issues that 'some' previous reviewers have posted. The first day I had to go into the laundry room to make sure it was still running because it was so quiet."
1.0,"""Not working - out of the box!""","The top loader was delivered and installed on Friday. We were out on Saturday and returned home after 9:00 PM; when we started our first load of wash (small delicates) we expected it to be done in less than 90 minutes. When two hours had passed, we noticed that the rinse cycle was constantly filling, spinning, draining, restarting over and over again. We finally shut it off manually and wrung out the clothes. When we call our local store, they reported that at least 4 of this model had been returned with same problem during the past week. They suggested we look at a different model which we plan to."
5.0,"""Great Washer""","This washer has a deep well, no center agitator which allows for more clothes, very quiet and most of all, it offers small, medium, large water supply of your choice. Most of the new machines don't offer this feature. The salesperson at Lowes was very kind to help me purchase this even though he was on his way to lunch. Wish I had his name but he went above and beyond his duties and cared enough to help me out. Great experience shopping at Lowes in Abingdon, Maryland."
5.0,"""Quiet""","My wife loves that it does not have the agitator and has lots of room for the clothes. It washes the clothes well and is a lot quieter than our old Whirlpool. I was going to buy another Whirlpool but the reviews was bad on the ones I was looking at and the Samsung was better. My Whirlpool lasted eight years I will have to see how long this one lasts it seems to have a better warranty, but time will tell."
4.0,"""Love this Washer""",My husband bought me this washer and the matching dryer. I love it and haven't had any of the problems that others have mentioned in their reviews. We did make sure that the washer was totally leveled. I really like the soft tune it plays when it is done. It sure beats a loud annoying buzzer. The only thing I wish I could do that you can't with this machine is change load size once it has started. Other than that it works great and no more bras tangled around the agitator!
5.0,"""Exceeded my expectations!""","So you've probably seen some of the negative reviews on this unit, and I almost thought I was going to be in that boat, however not the case.  Lowe's came over and delivered my washer and dryer combo, set everything up, and left.  The first load of laundry did what others on here said.  Kept repeating the rinse cycle and wouldn't stop.  I was almost ready to take it back when I checked to see if the washer was level.  It was definitely out of level.  I went ahead and leveled it up, and checked the dryer, it wasn't level either so I took care of that.  Threw in another load of clothes and sure enough, it started working great, and has been ever since!  The normal wash cycle takes about 90 minutes for a large load.  Which seemed like a long time to me coming from a standard washer, but the clothes are just damp when they come out, and the dryer gets them dry in about 15-20 minutes.  So not too bad!  Washes clothes great, quiet, and even sings to you when the wash is over!  Glad I purchased it."
5.0,"""Samsung washer""","Large tub, very quiet operation, sings to you upon each selection. Faster washing than our previous washer."
5.0,"""I Love This Washer !!!""",Bought this to replace my old washer with the agitator. I absolutely love this washer. Its big enough for a King sized comforter. It wrings the clothes out really nicely. I can do more in one load so that saves me time. I wasnt sure at first because I'd heard they take longer to wash. The cycle does last a little longer but I find its not a problem. There is a quick wash setting too which is pretty fast. I researched before buying about all the different washers. I was really afraid of the new ones without the agitators after reading reviews. I talked to a clerk at the store and he assured me if I didnt like it for any reason I could return it within 30 days. I loved it so much I went and bought the matching dryer within a couple of weeks! All of the bad reviews I dont understand. I've not had one issue yet and I've had it for about 2 months. I have no issues stopping the washer to add something if I've forgotten. It uses plenty of water and the clothes get fully wet and are cleaned well. Its so quiet when washing you dont even know its on. I am so happy with my purchase of this washer and the matching dryer!!! I cant say enough good about it ! I love love love this washer! I cant speak to the longevity of the product as I've only had it a couple of months. Bought the extended 3 yr warranty! Hope not to have to use it but just incase. Buy it ! I think you will love it!
5.0,"""Newer technology at a nice price""","We sadly had to replace our 18 year old Whirlpool top loading washer after the rinsing cycle started to malfunction. Choosing to price washers vs. research repairing the old machine, we chose to try a new model. Reading comparison reviews and speaking with a knowledgable salesman at Lowe's we found this model at a good price and took advantage of the sale and warrantee choices. This model has just enough 'bells & whistles' to meet our needs. The purchase/delivery/installation went smoothly and within 2 days we were washing clothes & sheets within a half hour after the delivery. The absence of the agitator doesn't change how we load our clothes; we never packed our previous washer too tight and are familiar with redistributing a load to prevent unbalanced cycling. We have tried all settings several times and have had no problems. There are no really strange sounds when you compare it to our older washer's agitator's sounds. The extra bonus of the Samsung is a quiet process of stages with a bell song at the end to tell us the load is finished!"
4.0,"""PCB Had to Be Replaced""","I had the same never-ending rinse/spin cycle problems with this washer that others here have described. I tried all of the fixes others listed here, including making sure to use HE detergent, loading clothes as if it had an agitator, heavy items on the bottom, leveling, power cycling, making sure the drain pipe wasn't clogged, etc. These things helped because my washer at least started working properly for certain loads but the problem still occurred about every 3rd wash load so I finally called Lowe's extended warranty service number. The tech came out the same day and suspected he knew what the problem was. Before he did anything, he checked my serial number and confirmed that the program control board needed to be replaced. According to him, the wrong PCB was installed in my washer and my serial number was in the range of the washers that had this issue. I do like this washer now that it works properly and kudos to Lowe's and their repair service. I don't expect every product to work properly so it is nice that they back up what they sell. I hear others have had problems getting warranty service from Samsung, which is unfortunate. It makes me glad I decided to go with the extended warranty and deal directly with Lowe's. From the guy I spoke to on the phone, who did a good job of confirming that I had tried the fixes before dispatching someone, to the tech who showed up way sooner than I would have expected, I had a great experience dealing with Lowe's extended warranty service."
1.0,"""Poor Product, Worse Customer Service""","I purchased this washer when buying our new house, and the spin cycle would run continuously. Because of this, the water usage skyrocketed because it would spin dry, then refill with water, and the electricity usage was higher than normal. Loads would take 6+ hours before I would shut the water supply off and spin it again. This happened for several weeks before the technician could come out. The technician fixed the problem within minutes and said that this was a known issue on all units produced within a 5 month window. These units were somehow not recalled, even though it was a known issue. My water bill spiked to $650 and $450 the two months that this was an issue (it was fixed part way through the second month) and Samsung has been less than useless at helping resolve the issue. I'll never buy another Samsung product after the miserable experience dealing with their “customer service” department."
5.0,"""Great Purchase""","I read the reviews here prior to purchasing this washer (and the dryer). I was a little concerned with the reviews about it continuously cycling, but it seemed like most people were able to correct the issues with learning how to use the machine. Since the set fit so nicely into our budget, and we have had great previous experiences with Samsung, we decided to give it a go.Delivery was quick and easy, and I have done easily 15 loads. As suggested by other reviewers, I placed the clothes within the dryer as if there was an agitator. I had absolutely no issues with it restarting, and it has been working perfectly. I like that there aren't too many options (if you like bells and whistles, it might be too basic), and it handles clothes, towels, and blankets with ease."
5.0,"""Spins the clothes to near dry""","We have this washer for 2 weeks now and so far so good. It is very quiet as it runs and easy to use. It has a lot of room and I just washed a comforter in it. I was worried that it would be too heavy for the washer and cause the washer to be out of balance and prevent it from finishing the cycle. To my pleasant surprise, there was no problem. This washer spins the clothes to almost dry. We had a front loader previously, which is supposed to spin the clothes to near dry, but this washer does a much better job at that. It is very deep, but I really don't mind that at all; however, someone fairly short may have difficulty reaching the bottom of the washer. I don't use the dispenser for the detergent though; .I don't see the point, as the detergent immediately runs down to the clothes. Maybe I'm missing something there? Overall, I am very happy with its performance so far."
5.0,"""New, works great so far""","I don't know if Lowes/Samsung is going to be discontinuing this model or not, but right now it's the best deal at Lowes for a top loader. My wife wanted it instead of a front loader, because she likes to take things in and out mid-cycle and she worried about that part with a front loader. Our previous washer/dryer lasted 16 years; we expect to maybe get 10 out of this combination. There's a lot of electronics on these devices nowadays and I think that could be more that can go wrong that you can't fix yourself. I guess we'll wait and see on that. Set yourself up with a warranty extension if you're concerned about that.I moved it around, didn't level it, didn't read the directions, just pushed the buttons and did a load. Worked fine! No issues! These washers are quieter, that's for sure. The agitator at the very bottom is electronic - that's struck me strange at first as it cycles on and off electronically. The (gas) dryer is on back-order, so we don't have it yet, but if it doesn't come in they'll need to come and take this out of here, because we bought the matched set. All total it was $1009.00 and you can easily spend 50% more on a washer/dryer combo, all you need to do is go and look. We bought this set because it was the best price and we're heading for retirement so we need to be a little mindful on how much we spend.Seems good, works great so far. One thing I did notice, and this isn't really a problem, is that when you select a large load and after it fills up and starts, you don't seem to be able to switch to an extra large load to put more water in it. It wants to keep to the original selection. Again, not a problem, you just need to know your loads when you first start.Lastly, great sales help at Lowes! She hopped on the phone, called the warehouse, found out when the shipment of gas dryers were coming in, reserved one for us... took care of business :)"
2.0,"""Worst Washer I have ever used""","I liked the design with the extra large tub. My washer was balanced. I followed all the instructions in the Samsung booklet and advice given by the salesman to operate this high tech washer. The washer would not cut off. I started a load at 3:30pm and it was still running at 6pm! It kept repeating the wash/rinse and spin cycle. I spent a lot of time checking to see why my loads hadn't stopped yet. I had 4 loads that stopped correctly after 1 1/2 hours. After 1 week of trying over and over again, I returned the washer to the store to get a regular washer one that is fast, efficient, and one with the wringer in the tub. Also, the detergent cup does not hold the liquid in place until you slide the door close, it just runs out onto your laundry. If you are a busy person and like to utilize your time wisely, this is not the washer for you."
4.0,"""Issues with vibrations AND leveling""","I received my new Samsung washer WA40J3000AW. It is a model without the center agitator. I was so excited to be the proud owner of yet another Samsung product. When the washer was delivered it was checked to see if it moved side to side, I guess this was the way to see if it was level. I started my first load of laundry and the spin cycle kept running and the machine finally reached the high ""rev"" and the just moved back and forth and vibrated a lot. This seems to be a problem with the machine per research on the Samsung website , as it has to be 100% level on all FOUR SIDES!! Please insist when the machine is installed that a level is placed one at a time on all four sides, verifying that the machine is level. I didn't know about this and took the installers word that it was level. When I called Lowes I was informed by my salesman # who by the way was totally Awesome!! Thanks Nic# that the person in charge of delivery/install told him to tell me that the machine was level when it was installed. But, I learned it wasn't because even though it would not physical rock back and forth when attempting to move it, the placing of the level on each of the four side proved it was not level. I was informed that they could send someone out to level it but it would have to be 6 days away, and that they could send another machine out but doing that would be a week or more out. I am so upset and frustrated. Not usually a thing that happens with Lowes customer service. Just remember INSIST that a level is used when the installer levels your agitator less Samsung washer. Still waiting for someone to level it correctly or have anew one installed..."
1.0,"""DO NOT BUY!""","I have owned less than 4 years.  I had a repairman out for the 3rd repair in this time period.  Instead of paying the $425 repair charge, I am cutting my losses and getting a new washer.  Samsung's customer service was pathetic."
5.0,"""Better Than My Previous Brand Washer""",This is the best washer we've ever had. There is no agitator sticking up out of the middle; our last washer trapped clothing under the agitator and cost us over $100 to have it fixed. The newer technology of agitating the laundry in the drum does an excellent job of cleaning. The spin cycle is so much more efficient that the laundry takes less time for my dryer to dry them. Very happy we bought this model. Easy to use and works great.
5.0,"""Read the book and you'll be happy!""","One of my favorite reviews of the HE washers basically said over and over ""Read the book"".. Seriously. That's all you need to do. This is one of the more simple washers to operate, and the book makes it easy. Don't throw your clothes in it - just circle them around the center and set it correctly, and it works great! This is fairly quiet, but it makes a few different sounds from a traditional washer - but it isn't the same so I'd expect it to be different. This model also ""sings"" at the end of a cycle. My only thing that I don't like is that the lid locks once you push start - but I get that is a safety feature - I mean the drum is HUGE on this. Great purchase for the price."
1.0,"""Walk away, if u want to keep it for awhile!""","We bought this 2 years ago.  Nothing but problems. We have had it fixed numerous times until our warranty ran out and now they no longer make the parts so we now have to go buy another washer. A few things that have gone bad. The pump. It gets clogged a lot, just from small things so then it wont drain. Also, getting off balanced =, we have had it replaced numerous times. I wasn't even doing heavy loads and when I have had people come out to look at it they have said this has happened all the time to people. Also, its a pain to figure out manually to bypass and have it drain if there is an issue. So, I would not recommend this washer. We are very dissapointed but we didnt do a lot of research on it before, so thats our fault. We just had to buy a new one and its coming this week. We decided to go with a front loader Maytag, better manufacturing warranties and its had good reviews."
3.0,"""Was Excited:(""","I am giving this washer 3 stars, but yesterday I would have given it 5. I was very skeptical going in as the reviews are very mixed for this washer, but it had all the features I wanted and didn't have all the extras I didn't need so I went for it. I was in love for a whole 4 days. I honestly love the way it washes, it gets the clothes very clean! It will fill with water to whatever level you preset so I really liked that it didn't skim on the water. You can pause the wash also to add in a garment if forgotten, or if like me, to be curious and see if it is actually filling up:). It has an extra large tub and while I had it I was able to wash my king size comforter without any issues, it actually looked like a full size comforter in the large tube:) Like I said for 4 days I thought I finally had the washer for my family of 7 that would last us for a long time......5 year warranty and all! Unfortunately, it has already malfunctioned in only 4 days:( When I went in to check a load I had put in, the entire board was lit up and the Medium LED was flashing. I got the manual and it states to call for service(really?) as the water level sensor is defective. I don't want to confuse anyone it does not sense how much water to use but for instance if I pushed for a medium load it would just keep filling up with water to the brim of the tub because the sensor that says it's at a medium or whatever selected water level is defective. As stated earlier, if this review had been written just one day sooner it would have been 5 stars, excellent etc etc.....I am giving it 3 stars b/c honestly I am so disappointed, but I loved the washer, I have 5 children and 2 have special needs so I have some heavily soiled laundry sometimes but this washer had no problem taking care of it. Everything came out exceptionally clean. For me, the reason I did not opt to exchange the washer is b/c of the previous statement, I have a lot of special needs for a washer and I just cannot be on hold for a repair man if it malfunctions and being it already has I am not confident that the next one will hold up either so I am choosing to go back to the older agitator models without all the digital features. If you get a good one, you will love it if this is what you are looking for, this is the only washer that lets you choose the water level without the agitator so I was so excited, but hey at least I got a good 4 days of washing done!"
1.0,"""DO NOT BUY""","I have had this machine for one day.  It takes over an hour to wash one load, constantly beeps and has to be restarted.  I started doing laundry at 3 pm and it is now 11:30 pm...Between the beeps and the restarts and resets I have completed only one load of laundry.  This is a terrible machine, I can't believe that Samsung would let this go to market"
1.0,"""Buyers remorse""",I am glad that I did not submit an earlier review with favorable things to say. I have had this machine since the beginning of June and had problems with it the other day. Called for service and they came out today. He brought a new memory board with him which alerted me right away that there have been issues with this model before. He installed the new board and was still making noise. The reason is that I need a new motor already!!! Three months and I need a new motor. I could not believe it. He is coming back out on Friday to fix. Called Samsung and ended up being disconnected. I was calling because I felt I deserved a new machine instead of a fix. She told me before we were disconnected that I would have to have three service calls before they would replace. I just happen to be off today and Friday so I do not have to take any additional time off from work. Maybe what happened to me was just a fluke and I won't have any additional problems with it for many years but I think buyers should be aware. I do have to commend the service repair company which came out promptly and tried very hard to correct the issue.
5.0,"""Top quality""","Replaced my 18 yr old Maytag washer and didn't think I'd find as good a washer as that one. But this Samsung is top quality. Have only used twice since it arrived but I'm very pleased. It is quiet, quick and the little jingle at the end is a pleasant up-grade from the old buzzer. I'd purchased the matching dryer about one month earlier and I am also very pleased with it. Keep up the good work, Samsung."
5.0,"""Loving this machine so far""","Have run about 8 loads of laundry thru this machine so far and have not had any issues. We made sure we followed all directions while installing the machine including making sure it was level and running a test cycle. Love the size of the drum as it fit & washed a comforter with no problems. My only issue is reaching to the bottom of the drum for that last lonely sock since I am only 5'4"", but a step stool solves this problem if needed. This machine is much quieter and does not shake/vibrate like my front load washer did. Hopefully it lasts for many years."
4.0,"""Perfect for cloth diapers""","Knowing that we were going to cloth diaper our first child I saw this on sale at Lowes while shopping for something else, after standing in store and doing a little research it looked like a great washer. I of course price matched, and used a military discount. I got the washer & matching dryer for the price of one! I saw quite a few reviews about it leaking water and coming home to a mess. We bought the pan for the bottom just in case, and didn't run the washer unless we were home for the first few months, but we've had no problems so I'm very comfortable starting a load of laundry and leaving. It has lots of cycle options, which is great for cloth diapers. I just change the cycle to heavy, push the presoak button and extra rinse. it's a 2 hour cycle and works great for the diapers.The only CON i have is that it holds water in the spot where you put detergent. it should be at an angle more so that all of the water comes out. if you don't do laundry for awhile I could see the water there starting to mold. Lucky for us that isn't an issue. I normally open the ""soap drawer"" all the way and stick my hand back there and push all the water out that I can just so it isn't sitting there."
1.0,"""Don't Buy Samsung!""","So we have been victims of Samsung now for months. First our dryer quit working after six months. It took them months to get it fixed. At first they said they were going to replace it, then changed their minds. Then we get a notice that our washer might explode. So we lost a bunch of money on that deal because they prorated the worth of the machine. Our year old machine was worth $300 less. We had to eat that cost. I had no intention of buying a new washer! Now my four month old Samsung replacement washer has a broken piece on the lid. Samsung won't replace the piece. They say it's not under warranty. They want $400 to replace the entire lid. Are you kidding me? Their business model is awful, and their customer service is worse. Buyer beware!"
1.0,"""Worst piece of Junk I ever bought!""","I tried washing a light weight blanket. It won't wring it out. It starts too, then stops, refills with water and tries again, and fails again, and again, and again. Then all of the light start blinking and it starts beeping, so I turn it off and redistribute the weight and put it on spin. It refilled with water 4 times. I redistributed it again and again it filled with water 5 more times! After 6 HOURS it finally wrung it out. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND ***DO NOT BUY IT!****"
5.0,"""Great washing machine""","Love it! Works really good, my clothes come out nice and clean and soft. This is the first brand new washer and dryer set I've ever bought and I really like it.I was on the fence after reading other negative reviews but I'm glad I bought it anyways.Good looking units, little taller than traditional machines. Runs quiet and doesn't seem to run much longer than traditional machines as some have complained. I also didn't feel they are obnoxiously loud, maybe a bit more than traditional units. I honestly think the majority of complaints are from people switching from 30 year old machines. You can't just cram whatever into it and expect the best results, I know as I've tried both ways!! Works it's best when you sort and select load type and size. I followed the manual and suggestions booklet and haven't had any problems! And on the fun side of this machine it plays a neat little jingle when the load is done vrs the old buzzer.I only have one complaint, the lid is plastic (and that's fine) and scratches extremely easy!! First time I set a laundry basket on the lid it made it look ugly :( I do miss the porcelain finish from the old machines!  Overall just like all my other Samsung products this one proved awsome!!"
1.0,"""Worst produict ever!""","I've never in all my years had a washing machine malfunction in less than 2 weeks of buying it. We have always had Whirlpool appliances but thought we'd give Samsung a try. This product is very noisy and sounded like it was on it's last leg from the first load.  We understood, however, that we just needed to get used to a new washer with new sounds.  Then last night, in the middle of a load, all the lights on the unit lit up, it wouldn't spin out, and water seemed to be backing up into the hose and tray where detergent is placed.  This was a normal medium sized load. There was no explainable reason for these issues.  Then I looked at reviews of this produce online (something we certainly should've done before ever purchasing this unit) and saw that others had experienced the very same issues with numerous people giving this product a ""1"" rating.  That too is what I am giving this product. I've never had an experience like this. Lowe's is coming to pick it up tomorrow and I'm getting a full refund."
5.0,"""Great Washer :D""","This washer is great. I guess they have worked out all the bugs with it. I've had no issues like some have posted here. It takes about 1 hr to do a normal load of laundry. I would guess a large or extra large load would take an hr and a half at the most. I've had no issues with repeating spin or rinse cycles like some have said. The lowe's crew set it up and leveled it and it works perfectly :)Use high efficiency detergent that is recommended. These types of washers don't use normal detergent that makes a lot of suds. Less suds means the clothes move around more during the wash cycle and get cleaned better. (I was told if you do use regular detergent use half as much as you normally would)When you load the clothes try to balance it out. It doesn't matter if washing a lot of socks and underwear or something but when washing 4 pairs of jeans even it out. Don't put all the jeans on one side and all the light stuff on the other so to speak. Really this is something that should be done no matter what washer you use. It's just common sense. Balance out the load as much as possible. It really only matters with heavier items like jeans, towels, sweatshirts, etc.You can put stuff in the middle but it will be on the outside when the cycle is done washing. it spins everything to the outside so you might as well leave a small hole in the middle when loading the clothes anyways. If you do put something in the middle make it small stuff like socks and lighter items. I guess you could just dump the basket of clothes in and go for it. I haven't really tried it but I don't think it is an issue unless you get all heavy items on one side and all light items on the other which makes it get out of balance. As long as it's reasonably balanced you shouldn't have any issues.During the wash cycle it runs a bit then cuts off. It does this over and over in short bursts. It is different from the older machines that just run constantly during the wash cycle. I guess this is due to not having an agitator in the middle or some sort of energy saving thing. It does work though so no issues cleaning the clothes :D"
1.0,"""Complete Garbage""","Within 1st year I had to purchase a drain pump relocation kit, because the pump broke and leaked water through out the house. Now the spin cycle won't work on any setting and the machine isn't even 3 yrs old.  I have purchased my last smasung anything."
2.0,"""I hate it""",I honestly hate this washer. It takes forever to wash one load (almost an hour) if not on quick wash and even quick wash isn't fast. I just timed a load on the normal setting and extra large load and it took an hour and a half. When the clothes are done the chime is obnoxious and really long. It doesn't get pet hair off the clothes and they come out looking the same way they went in. I was excited to finally get an upgrade in a washer and I unfortunately picked the wrong one. I love Samsung products but this washer isn't for me.
4.0,"""Quite, easy to use, cleans""","Purchased the brand after researching “most reliable”, Samsung came in near the top (ask me again in 15 years). I have read the reviews AFTER we purchased it, and became a bit concerned since people voiced frustration with the machine refilling and re-spinning endlessly. I than found a review which laid it all out reasonably; 1) make sure to use the required detergent, and 2) make sure to properly balance the load. Doing so results in a happy user. My wife's words: “I LOVE IT”."
5.0,"""So far so good""",After looking on line we only picked this washer because it was a Samsung procuct along with the matching dryer.  We did read over the neg reviews before we drove over to the store and my husband was still sold it. I guess because we have alot of Samsung products and they're working fine.... We haven't had any of the problems that people haven't talking about at least so far. Anyway after our old washer broke down. My husband decided to by the pair even as our dryer still worked.  Both the washer and the dryer has been amazing. It did take awhile to get used to the musical tune after the washer/dryer cycle. Not it was a problem.... the first time used it we was looking all over the place wondering where that sound was coming from...lol..Anyway it does an amazing job and we had to read over the book before we used it the first time because of all the different things on it.

1.0,"""Unhappy""","We used this washing machine for the first time a three days after it had been delivered. The first load was washed perfectly. After the second load of laundry was washed, there was a few inches of water left inside the tub. I read the owner's manual and as suggested, made sure the drainage tube wasn't twisted or kinked. It wasn't. Lowe's was great about exchanging this washing machine for an LG and knocked a little bit off the price for our inconvenience. There is no other company that compares to Lowe's customer service."
5.0,"""Works well so far""","We purchased this washer to replace our 5-6 year old Maytag. We went to the store and picked this out before reading any of the reviews. We have a Samsung in our vacation home and it has worked very well. We liked the fact that this had no center agitator and you could select a variety of load sizes. Our laundry room is in the basement and it has about 5 feet to pump up to get the water to drain. So far, after about 6 washes, we have had no issues and the clothes are clean and very dry when coming out of spin cycle. Due to previous water issues, we have our washer and dryer on a shipping pallet and there seem to be no issues with the leveling of the washer. Once out of the box, put on a level floor and the found the leg that needed to be leveled and unscrewed it and put in place on the solid shopping pallet. Again, this washer has worked great and we are pleased with the clothes."
1.0,"""Terrible Washer!""",I purchased this about a year ago and never liked it because it does not have an agitator but I thought I would get used to it but I have not. Not having an agitator is the main reason I don't like it because the clothes get rolled up in a ball in the middle and the it stops until you unroll them and it happens often. The other reasons are... 1. It will not spin large loads even on the largest setting. 2. It doesn't wash well. 3. The detergent dispenser is difficult to pour the detergent into and it spills on the clothes in the machine but if any detergent gets on the actual clothes it stains them. 4. It takes a longer than average time to wash even on the quick wash cycle. I have owned many other washers even front loaders and this is the worst one. Hope this review is helpful!
1.0,"""RECALLED LISTED and DROPPED DRUM""","So I purchased this machine in May of 2016. I then noticed the machine making a strange noise and as I have done before, paused it and opened the lid. The drum has dropped significantly 3 inches. This has never happened before! I noticed this as I washed my high end towels. Sad part, I was only washing 3 towels! Recall option doesnt even allow you to get your money back for the machine you actually paid for. An extended warranty and shotty repairs is not worth keeping this particular machine, however, worried that these machines at Lowes may also require a recall and incoviniece. ASK BEFORE BUYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,"""Too many problems!""","Lowes told us that this washer as a great one to buy for the money. In A few days later Lowes Delivery crew came by they had to install it upon the second floor along with the matching dryer, they damage the walls and doors in the home and were told to call Lowes about the problem. When we first turned on the washer machine the water was filling and over flowing our drip pan under the washer. We called Samsung and Lowes about the problem. First Lowes claims that we had to file with they Theird party vender, and Lowes does not take respondle for delivery, what a mess by Lowes, And now for Samsung, after the third repairs on the same problem, that the repairman could not fix the machine right or their was something wrong and currently the machine is still broken and lowes will not help but lay blame on others. I am shame by lowes on how low they ready are! It has take over a year to and Samsung finely gave us the money back on the machine. Would i good review to Samsung and Lowes, NO WAY THEY DID NOT EARN MY TRUST. AND FOR LOWES REALLY SHOWED THEIR TRUE SIDED FACE, ON HOW NOT TO STAND UP AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY WILL NOT SEE ME AGAIN! SO I GUESS I WILL FIND OTHER STORE TO BUY FROM.  SCHMITTY"
2.0,"""SAMSUNG WASHER ARE JUNK!!!""","I WAS TOLD SAMSUNG WASHERS WERE TOP OF THE LINE. THE WASHER I PURCHASED WAS LESS THAN 4 YRS OLD WHEN IT BROKE DOWN. IT WAS ONLY USED BY MYSELF 3 TO 4 TIMES A WEEK. I DIDN,T THINK IT WAS GETTING MY CLOTHES THE CLEANEST EITHERI WON'T PURCHASE ANOTHER SAMSUNG WASHER"
5.0,"""Sweet Machine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""","My wife and I purchased this item just last night and installed it with ease. I was a bit worried after ordering it online that according to some reviews that this washer blew major chunks but we put it in pretty quick and did what the book said and tried it and it worked just perfect without any issues at all. This thing is great! Very quiet and kind of weird i guess i am not used to the new sounds this machine makes and the jam it plays to make sure you take the clothes out of the washer is so cool. No more forgetting that something is in there and then realize after a few days that it was in there lol.... We love it and the cats will get used to the new sounds too lol.. they were tripping. My wife and son said it king of sounds like a space ship or something, I think it is soothing. Sweet!!!!!!!!"
5.0,"""Absolutely Awesome machine but watch the height.""","We bought this to replace an 5 year old ""major name"" washer that the fill sensor kept going out in, the big W will never get another dime of my money. My wife saw this one and liked the fact that the controls were straight forward and looked simple to use. This washer is the quietest washing machine we have ever had, you hardly even hear it going into the rinse and spin cycles, and on top of that our water bill has dropped by 20%.I was a little worried when my wife got adamant about wanting this one due to the recalls on Samsung products in late 2016, bet we have had ZERO issues with it.One thing to look out for and you will not notice it in the display setting is that this washer is 3-5 inches taller than most of the models it will be replacing, even if they are only a few years old. So you want to keep in mind if you are replacing part of a set, that there will be a height discrepancy. I have not checked it, but I believe almost all of the newer HE machines are taller than the older standard models.Also if you are going to get Lowes to deliver and set it up (I defiantly recommend this service, they even hauled to old one away) don't forget to get new hoses, they will not do the hook up without them."
4.0,"""Exactly What We Were Looking For, A Little Loud""","We purchased this washer September 2015. I was so insistant on getting a white, top loader, that was inexpensive. I got exactly what I wanted. With larger loads when the wash really gets going the washer is a little loud so I just close the laundry room door but all clothes, towels, sheets, seem to come out fresh and clean. Haven't had any problems at all. I like being able to choose exactly the kind of wash I want for each load and the tone when it's finished is nice. The front is dented a little. Not sure what it's from but it's hardly noticeable and isn't worth complaining about but worth noting."

Vibrates so bad there's a recall, to enforce the lid so it don't come off, but not to fix the vibration problem. And Samsung had contracted Dish to do their service. Worse machine, and customer service. Rather go beat our clothes on a rock, thats how bad it is. Read the recalls."

4.0,"""Great value""","I've been extremely happy with this purchase. I was worried about it's stability after reading some of the reviews on how you had to place clothes in the drum in a specific manner. When I'm doing laundry, I don't have time to sit there and arrange it in the machine, I tip the basket over and let the clothes fall where they may. I've not had any problems at all with the machine draining and refilling as other people have reported. My clothes smell better than they ever did with my front load set, even when those were brand new. One downside from no longer having my front loaders is because I'm so short (5' tall), my feet have to come off the floor sometimes to get socks or small items that are at the bottom of the drum when the load is done."
5.0,"""Great Washer""","The washing maching is great, Very quiet. Has everything I need."
1.0,"""Worst Purchase I've Ever Made!""","STAY AWAY!!! Bought this machine in 2013 and its been nothing but problems. Whenever it did work, it was awesome. I purchased the additional warranty and have had no one be able to fix it.The machine doesn't spin and it keeps giving me a ""dc"" code. They have replaced the motor twice, the computer twice, and the drain pump with zero success. I just got a call about 10 minutes ago from Lowes and they said since the machine is not repairable, they are giving me a full refund. My repairman mentioned that not only do the Samsung washers suck, but so do the Samsung refrigerators. He warned me to steer away from Samsung appliances."
1.0,"""SAMSUNG CUSTOMER SERIVCE DOES NOT EXIST""","PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TAKE THIS WARNING SERIOUSLY!!!!!!!!!! Machine broke and flooded my laundry room just weeks after the recall was completed. Washing machine is six months old. Going on NINE days now with Samsung customer service to get a technician out to look at. We are being told that there are a ""lack of service providers in your area"". Funny, when the machine was under a recall and there was liability on Samsung's behalf they had someone out in 24 hours. NINE DAYS, still no service technician and assessment of property damage from the flooded washer. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. Please go with another brand or this will happen to you."
5.0,"""I love it!""","I bought the washer, dryer pair.  Came on Monday.  I had to buy the HE detergent to use it.  It ran fine.  No problems whatsoever.  I had read about repeat filling and spinnning in other reviews but no problem with that.  My only issue is that the tub is very deep and I am 5'5"" and large breasted.  Very hard to reach the bottom to retrieve the items.  I will need to get a stool.  I should have thought of that when shopping.  Great price, on sale.  Looks nice with modern lines.  Clothes came out great.  Easy to operate.  Dryer worked well too!"
1.0,"""Try no stars.""",Absolutely under no circumstances would I recommend this product to anyone. It is horrible and Samsung customer service is even worse. 10 days so far without a washer and there is no sign of a repair man coming soon. They are trained to give you the run around until you give up. Worst customer service ever.
1.0,"""Worst washer ever!""","Bought this less than 1 year ago.  It was on the re-call list and they say they will reinforce the lid so that when it bangs, the lid won't blow off.  That will not fix this machine.  It has quit working altogether.  It doesn't wash, leaves all the laundry soaking wet.  When we set it on the spin cycle to spin the water out, it does nothing - leaves laundry soaking wet.  There is a rebate since it has been re-called, but they give you less that $350 for a new non-Samsung washer, $412 if you buy another Samsung.  I would NEVER buy another Samsung washer."
1.0,"""6 weeks old and it broke...""","Had this washer for 6 weeks when it broke. It would not drain the water on the spin cycle. Called Lowe's that same day, they transferred me to a repair place, next apt was 7 days a way. The repair people showed up 2 hours late. Could not fix it, ordered parts then waited another 2 weeks for the part to be installed. Over all AWFUL customer service from Lowe's, Samsung and the Repair company. When I called Samsung I talked to 5 yes 5 different people over a 90 minute period. They were no help whats so ever. I'll never buy another Samsung product because of the poor customer service alone. Spent over $200 over the 4 weeks of not having a washer at the laundry place."

5.0,"""This washer is ""Top Quality"" easy to operate!""","Excellent customer sales service and very knowledgable salesperson. The washer virtually wrings all the water from the laundry thus cutting drying time in half. I would recommend this ""Super"" product to all my friends! The sale price was lower than other competitors."
1.0,"""Not ""best purchase ever""""","This Washer from Samsung is bad.. • You cannot select the water temperature. Of course, you can select, according to the manual whatever you want, but the machine “picks” the temperature for you. Example: The selection - normal cycle (for soiled cloths which I would like to wash hot), hot water, medium load (which you can pick according to the manual) - actually fills with cold water. • Samsung customer service and Lowe's appliance sales staff is not aware that if you select “hot” the machine uses “cold” and will schedule a “service person” to come to your house to check it out (or swap the machine if it is less than 30 days old).• You cannot change the washing cycle. You cannot add cloth and change from small to large, from cold to hot load. Once the cycle started it will finish no matter what. • Extra Large, Heavy Duty has never been able to balance itself. The procedure to get this corrected is: 1. Wait forever (because the lid is locked while the machine is in motion) till the lock on the lid releases so you can re-distribute the load manually. 2. Re-distribute the load. 3 Turn the machine back on and wait and see if it worked. 4 Most likely you have to repeat the process 2-3 times because you can't see where the heavy side/low side is when you can finally open the lid. About a 10 minute processes. Samsung, I want a washing machine where I can decide the water temperature, open the lid when I want to add/remove cloth, change temperature or cycle. I want to decide when and where to save energy. Washing machines are for adults and trying to make it “toddler safe” with a locking lid (not talking about the child lock) and “energy efficient” by forcing me to use cold water for, as you list in your manual, heavily soiled cloth is stupid beyond stupid."
1.0,"""DO NOT BUY THIS WASHER""","First there is a design flaw when it comes to balancing the machine. Only the front feet are adjustable. That means you can only balance the machine front to back, not side to side. If you live in an older home and there is the slightest tilt in the floor there is no way to balance it. Next comes the rinse & spin cycle loop. If the sensors detect an out of balance load. which happens just about EVERY wash cycle, the machine will fill, drain and attempt to spin again. This results in a loop that can last for hours if you do not catch it. We have had this washer 4 months and our water consumption has gone up dramatically compared to when we had an older non-efficient washing machine. Samsung is of NO help on this issue. I would have been better off spending the money to repair my 15 year old machine over purchasing this one. If you like wasting time, money and water this is your machine."
1.0,"""worst washer I ever had buyer beware""",I had this for a couple years and I got a recall notice so I had the repair done the washer never worked right after that it kept going out of balance I had two repair men look at it and they could not resolve the problem I keep getting a run around from Samsung (wrong phone numbers or wrong departments ect.)they keep wanting me to schedule another repair man to drive 60 miles so they are grouchy when they get here and I have to pull the new Maytag out and put the Samsung back for them to work on it I am sooooooo done with it I paid almost 500 bucks for it and am going to haul it to the dump also I purchased the matching dryer for this and the bearings went out after a year I hauled it off to the dump also
3.0,"""Not so Great""",It takes too long for a wash and spin. My clothes come out so wrinkled that when drying them it does not take the wrinkles out. I do not like having to wait for the door to unlock.
4.0,"""Excellent washer choice""",This washer is easy to use with all the features I need. The only criticism is that it's noisier than I expected so I just close the laundry room door.
2.0,"""Only slightly less terrible than the dryer pair.""","I bought this washer just over 6 months ago with the dryer that is its pair. Here are all the reasons I would rather hand wash my clothes than use this.1. The fabric softener release doesn't work. At all. The minute you close it, it pours the softener directly into the wash.2. It doesn't get my clothes clean. At all. It basically gets them wet and tangled and nothing else.3. It tangles EVERYTHING I put in it. It does not matter what quantity. If you want to spent a good 10 minutes de-tangling all your clothes then this is the washer for you. If you want all of your clothes to be stretched out and excessively wrinkled than this is a great washer for that. You didn't know two towels could be tangled? Oh they can. If you put it in there, it will be in knots when you get it out.The only thing more awesome than this washer, is the dryer it goes with. You will spend 10 to 15 minutes trying to turn it on. Its awesome if you hate your life and want to stand in your laundry room all day."
1.0,"""Flawed Design""","The machine will not conduct a completely balanced spin even when empty. (And yes, it is properly installed and leveled; it was installed professionally by Lowe's.) The machine will attempt to re-balance the load by automatically adding water during the spin cycle, but because of the design flaw it never finishes the cycle; it remains ""stuck"" in the spin cycle in what amounts to an endless do-loop trying to re-balance, then spin, re-balance, then spin, etc. I've had the machine for two weeks at this point, and only one load of wash has actually finished a complete cycle, and that took over 3 hours. Thus far, to complete most laundry loads I have had to manually interrupt the spin cycle, usually after it has done several iterations at re-balancing, by shutting off the machine after it spins but before it can add water to re-balance. As you might imagine, this is quite time consuming and extremely frustrating."
3.0,"""Don't really like it""",Bulky and almost too tall. Can barely reach inside to get the stuff out of the bottom and i am 5'7. Can't get it close to the wall so it sticks out really far. You have to turn in on every time you use it and there is no option 2 turn the awful sounds off that it makes when it is done. Takes forever to wash 1 load. the quick wash takes 45 minutes!

1.0,"""Samsung SUCKS""","We purchased a Samsung WA45H7000A in December 2014 with a 3 year extended service warranty. This washer was a lemon to begin with. Unless you only wash 2 pairs of underwear at a time, it does not allocate enough water to get a load wet. Now it will not spin correctly and goes back into a repeat mode continuously. I have called 3 times to get service and there is no one in our area - Versailles - to service it. I want a full refund and will not wait the 10 weeks as I read another customer did. I ordered a Speed Queen washer today!!"
3.0,"""So many Samsung issues!""","I found out today that this washer is part of the voluntary Samsung recall. It has to do with the spin cycle on top loaders. Apparently, the top actually flies off during the spin cycle and people have been seriously injured. Great. There are things I like about the machine - it's quiet and you can fit a lot of clothes in the big, stainless drum. I even washed my King comforter in it! However, I wish it had more cycles, it's pretty basic. No casual or permanent press cycles, etc. Also, an issue with all Samsung washers is the warm/hot water isn't hot enough. I heard it has something to do with energy efficiency ratings for the U.S. So not only are we not allowed to fill our washers with sufficient water to effectively clean our clothes, but now the govt. wants to regulate our water temperature! Anyway, I will be trading this one in for something else very soon."
1.0,"""No hot water!""","Checked water temp after chose hot temperature setting to wash a load of whites. Not hot at all. Not even warm. Oddly enough, the hot water hose was hot so I knew hot water had come out, but cold water hose was cold as well, so I guess that ran too! This was on the normal setting. Called Samsung and was told that the new high efficiency washers will have significantly cooler water to save energy. What?! Okay, so what's the point of having option to choose temperature level if all you're going to get is cold water?! Not acceptable. Called Lowes and was informed they would send a technician out to check first and if not fixable, will gladly exchange for another machine. Geez, what an inconvenience Samsung. Also, the automatic detergent cup is missing so when you attempt to fill it with detergent, it flows right into machine as your pouring it! Had called Samsung about this days earlier and said would send cup in mail. Final issue, no sanitize setting or permanent press, but waterproof setting! What a waste. Didn't really notice this when purchased it, but now that we have it, see just how ridiculous this is. How often do you need a ""waterproof "" setting?! Right, me either!"
1.0,"""Junk""",Bought my washer in 2012 and have had issues with it since I bought it. Repairs have cost me well over the price I paid for the unit brand new. Water pump and bracket is located in bad spot so when they came to repair it they had to put a new mounting bracket on it and relocate it on the frame by direction of Samsung but because warranty was up cost me $277.35. Two weeks later it stops in the middle of cycles and now they tell me that the main board is out so now its costing me another $355.00. This all happened after the warranty was up by 6 months. Be aware of all Samsung products and note the There support is not only rude on the phone but also told me that once the warranty is up there is nothing they can do for you. I don't believe in extended warranties because if the company is any good they'll stand behind there product. buyer beware!!!!
2.0,"""Horrible product""",I've had it for months and it went out. No one in my area services Samsung. Trying to get customer service support from Samsung is a joke. They've already called me 4 times to confirm my refund amount. I have yet to see my refund. I do not recommend this product.

1.0,"""Do Not Buy""","Horrible product.  Where to begin...cycles are long...even for a small load.  Worst of call - is that even with selecting cold water, hot water comes out.  Be aware so you don't ruin clothes.  After several calls to Samsung CS and feeling like I'm an idiot (how many times will they ask if I've checked the lines), I've scheduled a certified tech to come out and look at the unit.  While I wait for the tech to come, I will be looking on Lowe's website for a new washer and dryer.  Do Not Buy Samsung."
1.0,"""Do Not Purchase""","Today - December 2nd - We purchased this Samsung washer on May 1st. There is a hot setting on thewasher, it never fills up with hot water, I have to shut off the cold water manually to get it to fill with hot water only. My whites are not white anymore, it does not clean like the old washers. I had a Whirlpool for 14 years no problems and no service calls ever. Our dryer went out and we thought we would purchase a new washer and dryer together...after the reviews we read we purchased this Samsung Washer and Dryer. Well no wonder they are on sale right now - we paid over a $1000.00 for the pair in May. The washer is stuck in rinse and when in spin it still thinks it is in rinse - the cycles are messed up. There are no children in the household so I'm not doing laundry every single day - not a lot of over use or anything. I called for service on November 23rd they came out on Wed. Nov 25 - service didn't even run the washer they knew about the problem with the mother board - it is on order and they cannot come out until December 9th to install it - CAN'T DO LAUNDRY UNTIL DECEMBER 9TH - THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND NO ONE CARES. 4 service calls and then Lowe's has a lemon policy...well this is a lemon don't buy it even it is on sale!!!"

This washer was an excellent price and is very good quality. This was my first time purchasing a washer and its perfect for my small family. The only reason why I didn't rate it five stars in the overall rating and the performance rating is because it will periodically stop during the wash if there are too many clothes in the wash or if the clothes block the center sensor. This can be quite annoying when you walk away for an hour and discover that the washer has stopped. So, if you purchase this washer, do not overload it with clothes.

The Samsung washer is quiet and efficient. The soap and softner tray is convenient and easy to use. No more having to remember to listen for the rinse cycle to add the softner, since you put it in at the beginning of the wash cycle. The clothes are clean and the washer spins more of the water out, so the drying time is less. The controls are almost self-explanatory and I love the quiet tune the washer plays when it finishes. This washer is a good value for the cost!"

5.0,"""Love it""","I looked at different washers and I always read reviews to decide which to buy. We bought this one because it was on sale and I liked the features and size. I was a little afraid with reading about having problems with filing and spinning over and over and having to learn how to use the washer. We've had the washer for a day. I absolutely love it so far. The men installed the washer and I've been using it since. I did read the manual. Its easy to use though. I love the soft close lid and the lights and tune it plays when you turn it on or off. We have a family of seven and the size suits well. The washer does seem to take a little longer than my old one sometimes, when I have heavier loads. The clothes are so much drier when it's finished than I've ever seen out of a washer. It has sped up the time in the dryer so I don't mind that. I couldn't be happier with the washer."
4.0,"""decent""","Does the job and simple to operate. Is not quiet but our laundry area is away from the living quarters and this does not bother us. I am not giving this washing machine five stars because if the laundry is not loaded in a balanced way, it gets stuck in the spin cycle and requires you to pause, rebalance, and resume."
5.0,"""Samsung 4-cu ft top load washer""","I read the reviews, I compared, I shopped around, and I settled on this washer. The complaints in the reviews seemed to center on noise and performance i.e. the cycle kept repeating itself during the spin cycle. I set mine up in the garage where the floor was almost perfectly level. Whatever leveling I needed to do took about a minute of tipping the unit back slightly and adjusting the front feet. I poured a couple of gallons of water into the tub and saw that the water leveled out on the bottom (suggested in the owner's manual) so I knew no further adjustments were necessary. After that it was a matter of securing the drain hose and plugging the unit in. We've run a few loads of laundry using different settings and my opinion at this point is this: If you take the time to set it up correctly (and level!) the unit performs perfectly, quietly, and efficiently."
1.0,"""Do Not Buy This Washer""","I bought this washer because it has a larger drum with allegedly larger capacity.  However the machine tore several garments, ruining them.  When a claim was made against Samsung, a technician looked at the machine and said I could only fill the tub 1/2 way with clothes.  Thus I went from a 2.7 cubic foot tub in my old washer to a  4 cubic foot one that can only be 1/2 filled.  Thus I now have 2 cubic feet to wash by clothes."

2.0,"""Not the best washing machine..""","It is rare for me to write reviews, but after using this washer for about 6 months I felt I had to.  This washer takes FOREVER!!  Quick wash on my front loader machine is 15 minutes, this one is about 40 minutes. It is terrible for washing anything big like sheets or blankets.  Somehow they get all folded over on themselves and it unbalances.  I have to stop it two or three times to redistribute the load. So you can never leave the house when it's running.   Also.. even when you pause it to do anything it takes about 2 minutes for it to unlock.  On a positive note, the clothes are clean it just takes forever and requires a lot of manual intervention."

My only squabble with it would be the fact that it seems to ALWAYS bunch my clothes up on one side before it decides to spin cycle. It almost nearly shakes itself apart trying to balance the off weight load that it creates inside, every time. I have to stop it, move clothes around to balance it correctly, then hit the go button again. Other than it shaking itself apart (or it sounds like it) the features and space inside is fantastic."

It does not need both . it takes a minute or two to unlock two...... when the load is unbalanced if you don't catch it , during the spin cycle the washer fills and spins over and over and over until you catch it and then if you don't get it balanced it will do it repeatedly until its balanced. I have had this washer do this for over an hour at a time. It is really stressful! If I had known about this feature i would not have bought this washer. I bought it because it has a nice big barrel with no middle agitator. The thing is the washer is so quiet you can't hear it. So when it does this fill and empty and fill over and over it can be awhile before you realize there is an issue!  it has the sound at the end of the wash but its also quiet unable to turn it up in any way. OH... when it washes it sounds like the barrel barely moves so it always makes me think the clothes won't be very clean. But they do come clean"
5.0,"""Perfect in his own sense""",It does everything that stated there is absolutely no problem and it is low maintenance as well. I have not had the product long but what I can say the bottom the washer done washing the clothes you really don't have to put it in the dryer long

5.0,"""Absoultely Wonderful""","The boyfriend and I just got out first place and was looking for a washing machine and dryer that would be an investment. After continuous months of searching around at everywhere possible that we could in North Carolina, We finally came across this washer and dryer set. We fell instantly in love with the sleek design and overall look and function(s) of the pair. We have had them going on almost a month and couldn't ask for a better washing machine and dryer pair. I can start a load of laundry in the dryer and leave and do my errands for the day and come back a few hours later and the clothes will not be cold or wrinkled due to having a wrinkle prevention setting on the dryer. That comes in handy more ways than I ever thought it would. The pair is quite for the amount of money that would be invested in them. I don't hear either of them going even when the washroom door is open. Overall; The boyfriend and I are extremely and utterly satisfied with this purchase and will be staying with Samsung for any further appliance needs."

It also programs for the amount of water to clothing, which saves on water. i like the dials which operate the usage of the mashine. The clothes wash and ring out pretty well.

4.0,"""A little shakey""","Following other reviews, we made sure the installers leveled all four corners of the machine. My only complaints I have are the song it plays after each load and smaller loads throw off the spin cycle really bad. I called Samsung about the song and there's no way to turn it off. It's a bit long winded, but not loud or overly obnoxious. The spin cycle on smaller loads is also easily remedied by throwing a couple towels in there to weigh it down. So far those are the only complaints and it's been almost a year! Washes clothes really well, gets them pretty dang dry on the spin cycle to minimize drying time, and for being an HE washer it's pretty fast, too. I'm glad we bought our own set to take with us to our next rental so we don't have to play washing machine lottery!"
1.0,"""Not good""","Had it a year, stopped spinning. Warranty people come out, says it needs a ""software update"". A few new motherboards later and it is deemed ""unrepairable"". Got a lowes merchandise card for the amount we paid for the washer. Not  worth the hassle."
1.0,"""Don't Do It""","I bought this machine and after 3 days it would not spin. It would fill with water and drain the water and nothing else. After insisting I would not settle for anything else the Lowes store finally exchanged it. The second machine worked for about 3 months and quit working completely. (I had purchased the warranty ""against my better judgement"") They came out and replaced a circuit board and the repair guy said he replaces them all the time!!!! now 2 years later it walks across the floor trying to spin and goes into an error code for an unbalanced load. Nothing helps...including Lowes. I am now trying to schedule the third service call in the last 3 weeks for this same problem....(Lowes is having computer problems so I have to call back again later) Trust me don't buy this washer especially from Lowes and whatever you do don't buy the warranty...take the money that you would spend on the warranty plus what you will spend at the laundromat and just buy another washer. That will also keep you from losing years off your life from dealing with Lowes about service...."
1.0,"""DON'T EVER BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!""","Worked for 35 days with out a problem, then after it was to late to buy an extended warranty in the first (30 days) the piece of junk broke! Stuck on rinse for 3 hours and would (NEVER) drain the water out of my already washed clothes! had to take the wet wash my clothes to the laundry mat and wash them again, then bring them home to the matched dryer that works fine.  I have tried 15 times to make it worked correctly and it would not drain! I read all of the reviews on this piece of junk and was dumb enough to buy it anyway thinking people were just complainers, I'm not usually a complainer but this is the biggest piece of junk I have ever owned in my lifetime, everyone of these should be recalled by the manufacture and replace all of the circuit boards so customers like myself don't have to go through this, there's no excuse for an appliance in this day and age to break down this fast! Now I have to wait for years to see when this pig is going to break again at my expense after the years warranty! Like I said don't even consider this piece of junk!"
5.0,"""It's all about how you level it""","What everyone here is saying is true. I hooked it up, ran an empty test wash on rinse and spin and it seemed level and fine. Added a load of jeans and about 10 min later, it lit up like a Christmas tree with the large light flashing. Book says water level couldn't reach the proper level.So I decided to re-read the manual further and used the instructions on how to correctly level the machine. With an empty machine, start it on rinse and spin and let the bottom fill up for 3-4 minutes. You want just the center circle exposed. If you fill it too much, use a pitcher to empty it a little. This showed me the front legs were in deed too low. 7-8 turns of the front legs later and everything looked even with the water level centered all the way around the center cone at the bottom of the washer.Reloaded the jeans and it ran the load like a champ. As others have recommended, after tossing in a load, I dig down the center and expose the bottom just a little. Helps you balance the load better too. On load number 5 in a row. Time will tell though.I don't normally buy extended warranties but Lowes has a 5 year for $99 (based on sales price under $500). My old Cabrio lasted just 5 years and went in 3 times for repair out of pocket. $99 for in home service is good peace of mind."
4.0,"""Good for the money""",Washes fine. Takes about an hour per load. Wished it had a deep fill option. Locking door is a pain to deal with if you want to add a garment. Other than that seems to do its job. Pretty quiet.
1.0,"""Terrible""","Terrible washer- won't fill up and wash, keeps flashing, but will fill up and rinse. Tech support just keeps sending me videos on how to fix it. It's level, works during the test cycle, (which is Rinse!)so I'm out $400. Don't buy."

1.0,"""I hate this washer""",I do not like this washer!  The water doesn't cover the clothes and you have to set everything on deep water or bulky item/sheets to get enough water to get your clothes clean.  I am all for conserving water but some of my clothes do not get completely wet when set on Normal or any other cycle.
1.0,"""Unhappy Customer""","We purchased this washer less than 3 years ago.  After we purchased the washer, I read many reviews on customers being happy with their washers for the first year or so then having problems that were more costly than a new machine.  I began to regret our purchase but we kept it hoping our experience would be different.  We were happy with it for the first 2.5 years then it started acting up.  Even though there is a 10 year warranty on the direct motor, the part that is messed up on ours is the piece that connects to the motor so it's not covered. Two years and nine months after our purchase, the cost to fix our washer would be  more than a new washer."

1.0,,"this is the worst washer I have ever had, had problems from day one, not only is this a faulty washer but extremely bad customer service. they will schedule an appointment for you alright but 2 to 3 days later then another week to order part. Their answer to my problem when I had a washer full of clothes and water, dip it out with a bucket. Stay away from this washer."
2.0,"""Recalled washer""","I got this washer in May 2016.We had no problems up till then.It was quiet and did a great job.Then we saw a report that they were being recalled because the tops would come off.That was early November.Samsung contracted Dish (the satalite tv people) to fix the problem. Larry the cable guy did a terrible job.Left a gap between the base and the top and now it is noisier then the 20 yr old washer it replaced and I have bin going round and round with Samsung for the last month. So if you are thinking about buying Samsung make sure the problem was fixed because all they have done for me is .....nothing.                                     How would I rate it  5 star before the recall 1 after the recall  How would I rate Samsung Support -5 stars.And Dish, they need to stick to installing satalite TV only."
5.0,"""So far my Wife & I love the set!""","I was a little leery at first about the washer especially, because of some of the bad reviews I read here. But with more good than bad ones I decided to go ahead and get it anyway. I sure am glad that I did, haven,t had any problems with it at all. I bought the washer and dryer set at the local Lows store, took them home and set them up myself. I was expecting to have a little trouble setting up the washer especially, do to the horror stories I read here. But I just followed the directions for set up that came with the washer, and had it set up in no time & working. So far no trouble with the set at all.The only problem so far that I can see with it is how deep the tub is for my wife. She has to really stretch to reach the bottom. Lol!!I did purchase the extended warranty on the set just in case I do have problems.As usual the Lows employee who helped me was very informative and helpful."

It does get a bit loud sometimes but that's a rare occurrence and not too noticeable because I have a separate room for it. I plan to keep this washer and have someone come out to repair it because it does a great job of cleaning my clothes.

This is my first Samsung product for home appliances, and with 6 months of use I would purchase another home appliance made by Samsung."

I didn't want a washer with 1,000 features I'm never going to use, either.This one fit the bill, and had a WONDERFUL price attached to it. I have never been happier.

5.0,"""Deal of the Century!""","First, I'd like to thank the people who returned this washer, because I got the deal of the century! I had heard horror stories about HE washers, and, after reading the many reviews both good and bad on this particular make and model, but am so glad that I decided to give this one a try.Yes - You must have the washer correctly installed in order for it to operate properly. Yes, it does make a much different sound than a washer with an agitator. And yes, you must use a low suds laundry product. My first load was a Normal/Large/Warm water load of towels. I use Molly's Suds products, which contrary to the name, produces no suds at all. The load does take a little longer than my old washer, but the clothing came out clean, and the washer spun them so dry that it actually took about 15 minutes off the drying time!I've since done a number of loads that included athletic clothing, a queen comforter and sheets, delicates, and each one washed, rinsed and spun without so much as a hiccup - even two of the smaller loads that were not balanced. I honestly couldn't be more pleased!"
5.0,"""Glad we bought it""",We purchased this washer in a set when a Whirlpool set we wanted to purchase was not available. After coming home and reading reviews for this washer we were afraid we had made a mistake. Not so far anyway. We have used this washer for several weeks now and have not had any trouble. We installed it ourselves but did take the time to level it up properly since so many had trouble with the machine in that respect. The test load went well and so has every load since then. One load that contained a comforter needed to be readjusted for balance but that is not an unusual occurrence with any washer. It has washed our clothes well and is quiet in operation. We would buy this washer again.
4.0,"""Great product""",I find this washer to be easy to use. It is a little louder than my other washer but seems to wash my clothes well.
1.0,"""Wrost washer EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!""",I didn't like this washer from the time I bought it and it only gets worse. It leaves dry spots on some clothes and white marks on others/ It doesn't matter if it's a small or large load it does it on every load. I've owned it almost 4 years and now it stops mid cycle and won't finish a load. I've checked for the problem based on the error code and there are 5 different things that most people are replacing before it will work correctly. Based on the price of the parts it cheaper to buy a new one. I called Samsung and got someone in INDIA who keep repeating the same questions over and over until I hung up. I filled a service center request form and someone from INDIA called and asked me same questions again. I will never buy a Samsung again.
4.0,"""Good value""","Purchased this washer to replace a Whirlpool Cabrio washer that could have been a nightmare were it not for extended warranty. The Samsung actually does a better job than the Cabrio. The Samsung actually gets all the clothes you are washing wet. You have to make sure clothes are loaded properly to reduce spin cycle vibration, making sure the water level is high enough helps. At least you can adjust the water level with this washer."
1.0,"""Danger - high risk of water leaks""",We purchased the model WA400PJHDWR in 2013 and experienced a significant water leak and damage to home when the water pump broke off during the fill cycle. This is a known design flaw in the washer. Samsung has issued no recalls or warnings to consumers. Lowes home improvement has not issued any warnings to consumers. Would not trust future models. Would only recommend this appliance if it is used in an outdoor location.
1.0,"""Problem with the Washing Machine; It never worked""",I purchased and installed the washing machine. It turned on but got stuck in the cycle and wouldn't finish. Tech support was unless. I made sure everything was balanced properly. I am not looking forward to returning it since I traveled 45 miles from the store.
1.0,"""Do not purchase this product!""",We bought this washer on 11/19/2013 it started getting out of balance and would keep filling up and not completing the spin cycle. We called the service number and was told it would cost $75.00 just to come look at it. They came and looked at it and said it would be $295.00 to fix with no guarantee the work. I feel like this washer should have lasted longer for the price we paid for this. We chose to buy another washer instead of putting more money in this washer. I will never recommend anyone to buy a Samsung product.
5.0,"""Love it!""","I was skeptical at first, reading some of the reviews, never had a washer that didn't have an agitator. The price seemed fair, so we gave it a shot.  My husband hooked it up and leveled it, which I had read was very important.  Did the test run, everything went smooth.  The washer cleans as it should, spinning cycle leaves the clothes virtually dry. I have no complaints, a great buy!  Also it is very quiet! Be sure to use HE detergent! I want the matching drying now!"
5.0,"""Great washer!""","I don't know why there are reviews saying this washer doesn't work. Just make sure it is level when you set it up and to use ""he"" detergent. Mine has worked great from the start and I love it!"

It had one recall on this model before we bought it and now there is another. Ours doesn't spin... after 4 months with a family of 3. Samsung has a 1 year warranty but it will take over a week, if we're lucky, to get someone out to look at it. It's a known issue after doing a little internet searching. Great.

My last washer (Whirlpool Cabrio) was quiet. I've had this washer a month and haven't got over that fact. Lots of plastic; the door, the control panel, the detergent drawer, etc. So far both my husband (handy guy) and myself have been trying to remove the detergent drawer according to the instruction manual but we've been unsuccessful. We quit because we're afraid we'll break it. We'll need to call the company on this. I do like having the drawer that dispenses both soap and softener (another hard to find feature). As far as cleaning without an agitator, hmmmmmmmmmmmm, our white sox have looked better. Looks like you get what you pay for."

Our family went back to basics. A washer that does what it is designed to do without the fancy load options that aren't needed. This clothes washer works great and was at a bargain price. We were once were suckered into another brand before this one and supposedly a high end model with a plethora of extra features and electronics. But we learned the hard way, the more items you have the more things that can go wrong. This is a quiet running model, even quieter that the other washer we had and that one was supposed to be quiet. This model has all the basic features you need. You don't need any other model. We're happy and glad we went back to basics, I suggest you try it, you won't be disappointed."

1.0,"""DON'T BUY THIS!!!!""","We purchased our Samsung maybe 6 months ago and from day 1 I was having problems. I read the book forward and backwards. First load I washed it like to have rocked off the concrete pad in our basement. Okay so maybe it isn't level as we thought it was. Fixed that, check. It was all level, clothes not just dumped in, laid accordingly. I wanted to be excited about being able to wash without the agitator being in the way and being able to put comforters in to wash. Second load of clothes did better. Third load ran forever, I thought I know it has been over 2 hours, why is it not done yet? All the lights flashing, signals dinging like crazy, clothes either are not wet at all or soak and stuck on the rinse cycle playing peat, peat, and repeat. So you are forced to manually put in rinse mode, then it doesn't spin out, it just keeps refilling, then you put it on spin and it runs forever. A load of clothes doesn't take 3-4 hours to wash I kept complaining. Absolutely ridiculous. My husband thought I was making it up. Maybe you're doing it wrong. Yeah, like I don't know how to use a washing machine like I have been the last 35 years. So you are the expert, you make it work right. Until he finally tried to wash a load (which he never has in his life) and it did the same to him. Then low and behold we receive a recall in the mail for our model less than 6 months after buying it. Problem is they aren't even giving us half the amount it cost to buy a new one with an exchange rebate if we stick with a Samsung product. Even though the paperwork clearly states you will get an ""additional"" loyalty incentive of up to $150 if you choose to stick with a Samsung. So I am thinking okay, they are offering to give me a rebate of $372 for my old one plus up to $150 extra as a loyalty incentive to buy a new Samsung to replace this one, and maybe get a better one??? Yeah, well no, wrong again. That amount is added into the rebate. So I am stuck deciding do I just take the $372 for a rebate exchange on a new Samsung, or take $272 for the purchase of a new non-Samsung brand. Absolutely ridiculous!!! Samsung customer service was horrible. No one spoke English, so I decided to use the chat on the computer instead. Yeah, it's all scripted and never answered any of my questions. So the only good part about it is since it was purchased at Lowes they have to pick up the old one, once we buy a new one. Then we're stuck coming up with the money for a new washer up front, filling out the mail in rebate, and mailing in our receipt to have our rebate back within 4-6 weeks I was told. I usually like the Samsung brand, but after this fiasco, I doubt I will ever buy another item made by that company. I will do my research first before going back to buy another one. Apparently after just now reading everyone else's reviews from the past year, I would have known what problems could arise and not buy one and waste my time, and my money."
1.0,"""Never buying a Samsung product again!""","I am never buying an appliance, or anything from Lowe's ever again! I had the most horrible experience ever. First of all the people who Lowe's sent to deliver, ended up breaking the drain pipe while removing my old washer. As it turns out the delivery guys do not work for Lowe's, i guess Lowe's hires private companies to handle their appliance deliveries. Point being that they said they are not responsible for the damage! I had to track down the owner of the delivery truck just yo get the pipe replaced. And to top it off the New washing machine did not work! I am so dissatisfied with Lowe's leaving me the way they did. I will not contribute to a company who leaves their customers to have to track down the responsible party. Buyers be aware when buying appliances at Lowe's!!"
4.0,"""This is a good washer""","I read many reviews on this product (many of which were unfavorable), but we have not experienced any of the problems experienced by others. You definitely need to read the installation and operating instructions carefully - loading the washer properly, and knowing what to expect from each cycle is critical. We have had the washer over a month, and have used every cycle and other settings available. We have had no problems. Because of the large capacity, we find that we wash less frequently than with our 30 year old washer. There is no softener dispenser on this machine, but we use dryer sheets, so that isn't a problem for us.Overall, this washer is a good value for the money."
1.0,"""Stay away from Samsung products.""","Bought washer in December, SIX Months later... the machine would not spin during the cycle. Both the motor & computer board have  to be replaced. It's  Unacceptable,  to have a 6 month old washer and have so many problems with it.Called for repair on June 1st. It is now June 12th, still no repairs. No phone call to schedule a service call. Warning...do not buy Samsung...Parts take forever to come in. Went to Lowes, asked about the wait on parts for repair. The guy in appliances told me the parts have to come from over seas. Find it hard to believe they don't stock any parts in the U.S.A. But if that is true...Stay away from SAMSUNG.... unless you have all the time in the world to wait on parts."
5.0,,No agitator! I like that there is no agitator in wash tub. Tub is bigger than expected. Very nice washer.
5.0,"""Samsung washer""",I purchased this washer when my 15 year old whirlpool kicked the bucket. I am really pleased with this washer. I don't miss the agitator in the middle and after a few days of non stop washing it still works great. Clothes are clean and the spin cycle really wrings out the water. The little jingle at the end is a nice touch. My only complaint at this time is that the washer tub is really deep. I am 5 foot 4 and have to stand on my toes to reach in and get clothes out of the bottom. Anyone shorter than 5ft would need a step.

That being said I contacted  Lowe's and they are swapping out the washing machine for a different make a model. Thank you Lowe's for your customer service .

Then taken to the repair shop for a few days and still problems after their tech worked on it. Several calls made to SAMSUNG TECH HELP AND NO RESULTS! Samsung just wanted to argue over the phone with the service people. The repair company totally frustrated with Samsung. Repair company told me that they just give up. Great people there and hated to put them through this with me. Company HNG. What does a customer have to do to get it replaced with a new unit. I'm going back to Lowes and will attempt another try for replacement. When this is all taken care of I will contact BBB and file a formal complaint against Samsung and whoever else will listen. I swear it going to blow up before it gets replaced?

5.0,"""Love this product""",I love this product because it simple and gets the job done. The main reason I bought it was because of the reviews as well as the quickwash. The quickwash makes it so easy. My only one complaint about this model is that it does not give you an exact time when the load will be done.
4.0,"""Great Product But?""",Love this washer except for the fact that loads tend to get off balance easily during the spin cycle causing the machine to vibrate intensely.

5.0,"""Great Washer""",The washer is relatively quite during operation and plays a nice chime once it is finished.  Only bad thing was that the feet left black marks on our floor during the installation. I figure that it's because the feet are made of extremely soft rubber to prohibit moving during the spin cycle.
5.0,"""Great washer""","Although I just got my new washer , I really like it. It is pretty easy to operate,quiet and smooth operating. The only thing that I have to get used to is it takes longer to do a load of wash than my old washer Other than that it is very nice. I think that when I get used to how to gauge my load size it will be less time than it took for my 1st load. I thought I had a large load and I believe it was actually smaller. It really holds a lot of clothes. Either way ,I really like it."

I have had no issues with this washer. Great value for the price and will probably buy another SamSung appliance based solely on their customer service! It has been fantastic!

2.0,"""Spin cycle after washing keeps filling with water and spinning""","I am a totally Samsung user. I was so excited to see my new Samsung washer WA40J3000AW be delivered. I was very disappointed when doing a ""Quick Wash"" cycle that the washer kept filling with water, spinning and going through the same process over and over. After 1.5 hours and 3 separate times the washer filled during spin I finally stopped the washer. There is definitely something wrong with the washer."
4.0,"""product is efficient""","washer is sensitive and just a little unbalance during the spin dry cycle will not turn off.

My last washer (Whirlpool Cabrio) was quiet. I've had this washer a month and haven't got over that fact. Lots of plastic; the door, the control panel, the detergent drawer, etc. So far both my husband (handy guy# and myself have been trying to remove the detergent drawer according to the instruction manual but we've been unsuccessful. We quit because we're afraid we'll break it. We'll need to call the company on this. I do like having the drawer that dispenses both soap and softener #another hard to find feature). As far as cleaning without an agitator, hmmmmmmmmmmmm, our white sox have looked better. Looks like you get what you pay for."

1.0,"""Nothing but trouble""","Our washer came missing the blue detergent tray. I called into the service center and they gave me a number to fax my receipt and description of part that was missing. Well, after 6 months and being hung up on at the service center several times I finally received the part. Now, we can't run a load using cold water. Every load is scalding hot even if the cold water button is lit. We have called several times and Samsung says nothing is wrong and to only use hot water. Today a gal told us the only way to get cold water is to run your load through the delicate cycle. Well guess what....its scalding hot. Samsung's service center is worthless....will never buy another Samsung of any kind. They are terrible to work with."
1.0,"""Washing Machine Model #WA400PJHDWR""","We have been through two Samsung Models #WA400PJHDWR in less than three years.  Lowe's replaced the first one after months and months of attempting to repair it, but to no avail.  The second one went up not long after the warranty expired; imagine that.  I contacted Lowe's once again, but they just wanted to send a repair person again.  They transferred me to Samsung directly; Samsung will not do anything to honor customers and stand by their products."
3.0,"""did not like it""","This is a HE washer and it has a ""deep water fill"" option on it, but it still does not hard cover the clothes in water. I absolutely hate the new HE washers. I thought this one would work for me, but I used it a few times and sent it back to the store. It does not have an agitator either which is disappointing."
5.0,"""Looks and design""",This machine is easy to use and works well. But I haven's had it a week yet. Pros: The biggest advantage is the ease of operation and quiet. It pretty straight forward. The biggest Con is the door locks so you cannot see inside the machine. This machine need a see through lid.Lowe's needs to improve on its competition and offer free haul away on the old appliance. Someone making money on the metal.

SO FAR MINE WORKED 2 TIMES . REVIEWS SCARED ME WHERE I EVEN KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS TROUBLE WITH IT RUNNING HRS AND NEVER SHUTS OFF . SOME DRAIN AND FILL OVER AND OVER . I AM SHORT TO THIS IS THE SIZE I HAD TO BUY SO I CAN REACH BOTTOM TO GET CLOTHES OUT.

1.0,,Very unhappy with the quality of this washer. Sounds like it is going to fall apart when on spin cycle. Takes way too long to wash a load of clothes.
1.0,"""Problematic""","The first time this thing broke, the tub was full of water and it spilled onto my second floor of my home.  The repair man said that piece broke on them all.  Gee, that makes me feel better.  Second time it stopped working, it took two weeks plus to get it back up and running.  Third time, the repair man finally said it's not fixable.   Thankfully I bought the 5 year warranty because I've had it for 4 1/2 years.  I'm sure it would've broke again as soon as the warranty was out.  This is all in addition to having the recall fixed."
4.0,"""A simple no bells and whistles machine to use.""","Didn't want all the extra features I wont use like most of the machine featured.his machine is simple and easy to use. Machine features cycles and temperature settings but not all the extra that I would never use. The quick cycle was great for doing a fast load. Don't really care however for the soap dispenser though.Love the machine,"
5.0,"""Solid washer, especially for the price!""","Our front load washer finally died after 15 years so I read reviews on lots of washers before deciding on this top load Samsung. Despite the warnings of some reviews about this washer I figured there were many more positive reviews than negative. Lowes delivered for free and installed the next day after purchasing online. I asked them to make sure it was level and they said it was. We ran a self cleaning cycle with nothing in it which lasted about 30-40 mins before loading it with towels and setting it to large load. Worked like a charm! We had tons of laundry built up for 3 days due to our dead washer so we must of ran 6 more loads that first day. Never had a problem! My wife said she loved this washer compared to our old front load one. She is able to put so much more I to this one and it's easier to load and unload. We even were able to wash both our daughters' comforters with no issues. My wife would have had to take them to the dry cleaners or a laundry in town if we were still using our old washer. She is ecstatic. We have only had for 4 days now, but so far so good. Lots of room for loading our 4 member families laundry and is as quiet as our old Bausch front load washer. I would recommend this washer for sure."

5.0,"""Big tub and cleans great""",I usually don't write reviews but I couldn't pass the opportunity up to recommend a great washer . I read so many reviews before I decided to buy this set. I'm very thankful for all of them. But this washer is a great washer all around. Very easy to use. I mainly chose this one bc you can pick the size of Load. I had a maytag prior to this one and it had the auto load sensor. I like picking my amount of water. It spins the clothes so much they are practically dry when you put them in the dryer. It cleans my clothes with no scrubbing or soaking. I love this washer. It's easy to use. I usually have probably 3 loads of colors to wash a week. I can get almost all in one load. The tub is HUGE

2.0,"""Won't stop spinning""","This washer really gets clothes clean. I love the load size.Our issue is that the spin cycle never stops! It goes on for hours! This morning, it took 3 hours to wash one large load. The spin cycle continuously fills with water. I couldn't get the washer to pause and unlock during the 2nd hour of spinning. I finally unplugged the washer and quickly paused it so I could get the clothes out before water started pouring in again. Our water bill has increased about $25 a month. I just about fainted when the water bill was over $300 for a 2 month billing cycle. That has never happened in 30 years of living in this house and we even fill an above ground pool each summer."
1.0,"""The product is very modern in appearance""",The product looks nice. It does not clean your clothes well. It is fairly noisy but not in an annoying way.

The automatic detergent dispenser is very handy, also. I like the selection features for wash size, temperature, and the fact of always cold rinse is very important. The spin cycle is powerful and quiet too. I did recommend this washer to others. I believe I am a Samsung convert."

5.0,"""Very quiet""",The washer pulsates which threw me off at first and then I caught a friend who has the same product and said that was normal she also had her product for several years and she's still checks on it to see if it's working or not that's how quiet it is I am in love with gadgets and this fits me. And the best thing is that it has bells and whistles literally.
4.0,"""Greatest bargain""",This washer is great. The only drawback is that it seems to take a long time to complete its entire cycle. ( about 45 minutes. Is that normal?) I love the really large capacity.
4.0,"""This product has great features but weird water temps.""","So far my only complaint is when ""cold"" water temp is used there is a hot and cold mix. Hot water alone sprays on clothes for a while not warm water. I don't like the hot water on my good clothes and I don't understand why the water uses hot at all for the cold temp."
2.0,"""Does not clean very well""",I recently purchased this item and was so excited about the fact of not having an agitator as well as having the extra space. I was greatly surprised as to how bad this washer was. I put my husband's clothes in it and they smelled worse when we took them out than when we put them in. It does not appear to be washing anything. It makes a noise for about 10 secs then quiet. If it was really using 'wave' technology wouldn't it be making waves continuously to be cleaning the clothes? Makes no sense except to say that it just leaves my clothes in a vat of water to soak in filth then rinse what filth it can out. And spin like crazy to dry. Wish the 'wash' cycle worked as well as the spin cycle.
5.0,"""Great Product!""","Really like how easy this washer is to use. It runs quietly and efficiently and always gets my clothes clean. It spins out nicely, so when I go to empty the washer they aren't sopping wet. I have had such a problem with previous washers. Overall really glad I bought it."

When my old washer finally gave out I decided to go ahead and invest in a brand new washer and dryer instead of a reconditioned set and I cannot believe what a difference it has made. I am a sucker for technology with lights and sounds, so I am a big fan of how this washer powers on. The big difference is in my clothes though. They smell so much cleaner and feel so much softer instead of dreading doing laundry I am washing everything in sight! It is quiet, does a great job, and is a pretty good value! Just another Samsung product I love and am glad I purchased. I would recommend it to anyone!"

1.0,"""DO NOT BUY HIS MACHINE""","DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!  This is not a washing machine.  It is a rinsing machine.  It does not use enough water to wash clothes and takes a long time and it uses too much water in the rinse cycle and does not rinse them long enough.  The machine does not allow you to tell it what to do . . . it does what it is pre-programed to do.  Of all the appliances we have ever purchased, this was the most expensive and it ABSOLUTELY the worst appliance we have ever had.  Do not expect Lowe's or Samsung to do anything about it.  When your check has cleared the bank, you are on your own.  Good luck getting clean clothes . . . will to happen with machine.  DO NOT BUY THIS RINSING MACHINE."
2.0,"""Not built to last""","I've owned this machine for 3 years and I almost can't wait for the extended warranty to run off so I can replace it... After 3 years of use, here are my findings ..1. The machine rusts from the bottom up. If you look at the spot where the bleach goes in, somehow, without spilling bleach, the area rusts. It is a small space to pour bleach so you can never pour directly from the bottle otherwise you will spill it. We use a plastic measuring cup to prevent spilling...yet the machine rusts. 2. if you have one towel and a full load of clothes, the machine is out of balance and it will keep filling up with water and rinse until it gets tired at some point and starts beeping. You must wash like pieces of clothes ... for example, you can't put a sweatpants with a bunch of shirts. The sweat pants becomes too heavy and the machine is out of balance. 3. In order to really wash the clothes, you must put it on heavy duty wash otherwise the machine does not take in enough water to wash the clothes. Sometimes the machine will be running for 20 minutes and if you look in, the clothes in the middle are still not wet. All of that said, it is quite possible that all machines work this way and only because we can see through the glass on this one, we can complain about it..."
2.0,"""Nothing but trouble.""",We bought this machine 4.5 years ago.  We have had nothing but trouble with it. It went dead THE DAY AFTER the warranty ran out and we have had to have it repaired a number of times.  Finally decided to buy a different washer.  Will never buy another Samsung.  EVER!
1.0,"""Worst Produce Ever""",This washer worked for about 6 months and needed to be repaired by Samsung 3 times in as many years. Now the washer started leaking. The washer rocked during the spin cycle so excessively that it usually did not complete its cycle. Samsung Customer Service claims the excessive rocking is caused by the laundry detergent which is impossible since I use the recommended type and amount of detergent. Samsung Customer Service has not responded to numerous calls and emails. I will never buy another Samsung washer again and would not recommend this produce to my worst enemy.
3.0,"""Recalled""","I haven't had many problems with this washer, but it does shake a fair amount.  This washer was recalled by Samsung.  Apparently, the whole top can become dislodged when washing bulky items. So now I've had my washer for 8 months and I already need to schedule a repair. They offer a rebate for those who want to buy a new washer instead, but the rebate is less than what I paid for the original and you have to wait 4-6 weeks to be reimbursed."

5.0,"""Love this washer""","I was worried about buying this particular model after reading the other reviews here, but since I figured I had a 4 out of 5 chance of loving this washer I thought I'd give it a whirl. I was not disappointed! It's a great washer. I've had it for about 3 weeks now and not a single problem. I've even washed my area rugs and blankets - no problems at all! I would definately recommend this washer, and especially Lowe's! Their staff was helpful and friendly and answered all my questions and even changed my delivery date without a hitch!Way to go Lowe's <3"
1.0,"""Owned for ONE WEEK""","I was happy about getting a new washer, until it started to give me trouble! The digital programming started to glitch after only 2 days. Upon turning it on the lights would just flash on and off and it would not let me select the size of load action, or the temp. The cute little song it played at the end of the load was not enough to make up for this. Also the lid locking in place is a nice safety feature, if you have kids. I don't. I hated that. I like it to be able to check the suds level and the water level to be sure its enough for the load I put in. I was not able to actually learn how much clothes matched the size of the load selected because I could never see it! Also, the plastic lid has a soft close feature and I liked that it would stay up at a half open position, but again, its plastic. Scratches would not doubt make the thing look *used* in short order. All in all I would say avoid this washer. Go with one that has more manual dials that wont be freaking out after only two days."
1.0,"""Washing machine knocking & shaking during 1st use""","So disappointed in this washer (4.0 cu ft) by Samsung. The only thing good about this washing machine is the price. Other than that.....it's a no go. I just had this washing machine delivered on yesterday and its already making noises. First off, it sounds like a jet engine mixed with a lawn mower. During my very first wash, it was shaking and making knocking noises as if I had it for 10 years.  I will now have call for a service appointment after 1 day of use. Something doesn't sound or feel right with this scenario. Purchase at your own risk my friends."
5.0,"""Great Machine""","I have seen so many terrible reviews on this washer and I don't understand why because if you read and follow the instructions it works like a dream! There is no agitator in this machine, there is a sensor instead. So you still need to load the machine as if there was an agitator (around the machine in a circle, keeping that sensor clear)and you will have no issues. My clothes come very clean and smell wonderful!"
1.0,"""Not worth the time and money""","I didn't think this washer was so bad when we purchased it 10/2015. We did the best we could to level the floor to prevent the appliance from rocking, like most other users complain about. Nothing seemed to matter; the machine constantly rocked on any load, balanced or not. When the recall occurred, I started using the ""delicate"" setting, which has now been dubbed the ""heavy bedding/waterproof"" by Samsung. This helped a little, but not completely. I'm going to accept Samsung's rebate and buy a different washer from a different manufacturer. (Which sucks because they're only offering me half of what I paid for it.) I even hate the dryer that is supposed to accompany this unit. I've never been more unhappy with a washer and dryer, and that includes the rentals I've lived in!"
