4.0,,Active wash is very handy when you don't have a sink in your laundry room. Washes well. It is a little noisier than i expected for today's machines but nothing to think twice about. I would recommend this washer and the dryer purchased with it.
5.0,"""Best washer I've ever had""","This washer is just wonderful. I love the sink option. It is easy to use. I was a little skeptical of how clean my clothes would be but to my surprise they are very clean. The wash spins gently back and forth verses your regular agitator aggressive wash. However, the only complaint is some of the wash cycles are a little lengthy. The normal wash with aqua jet deep clean soil level on heavy takes approx 1 hr 52 minutes. There are two other cycles that take 33 minutes and 36 minutes. The bedding cycles take an hour. I thought the spin cycle was going to sound like NASCAR but it is very quiet. The loudest part of the cycle is the water draining. So I think you will be very happy with this washer. Once the washer ends the cycle it plays a cute little happy tune."
5.0,"""Wonderful Machine""","This is a wonderful washing machine for HE haters and HE lovers! The machine has lots of features and the clothes are coming out super clean with super fast cycles. Much better than my old HE whirlpool Cabrio machine. The Samsung is still an HE machine but seems to add significant water and has special sprayers, and if you feel you still need more water you can press the Water Jet button on the sink and add even more water. I love the sink! Great feature! Also very durable all stainless steel inside drum. Also noticed the lid unlocks quickly. Best washer ever! The washing machine is more expensive but worth it; however to save a few dollars we just got a Maytag basic dryer which is working great."
5.0,"""LOVE this washer.""","Coming from someone who replaced a front load with this one... Bought the white one a few weeks ago, no problems. I love it. It cleans well, huge capacity! I can easily wash my king size comforter. Huge plus. I only gave it an average on the features because it does not have a button to automatically perform another rinse, you have to go back after the cycle runs and turn the knob to rinse. This is my fault for not noticing that before I purchased. My husband has very very dirty garage clothes which it cleans no problem, but I used to run another rinse just to be sure because of the high efficiency-less-water thing. No big deal because I am so happy with it otherwise. It's a good buy. Have used the sink a few times too. Very handy."
1.0,"""Terrible warranty experience""","My washer and dryer both failed in the first 9 months. The Samsung warranty process will drive you out of your mind. You will experience the typical overseas call center runaround and multiple phone calls wanting you to to do silly tests, until they finally assign a local service person. Don't buy Samsung!!!!"
5.0,"""Quiet, High Quality, Works Great, Fun & Easy 2 use""","Keep in mind this is a review after my 1st load- I plan to update this review after a few weeks. Initially very happy with the smooth sleek design and control panel. Sound effects are cool! Quiet while in use. Be sure to follow full installation- many people hook up hoses & go, don't forget to LEVEL MACHINE! I believe that's why some people's ""exploded"". Also completed the job much quicker than our previous 3 year old GE set. The first load I did was a single ""hand wash only"" sweater. I ran it on Delicate with ""no spin"" thinking that's best for hand wash. It did a great job and was cool seeing washer in action through lid (you can still see through the built in sink, I was concerned about that). When completed it did a long happy sound! Sweater was soaked tho, so I ran ""spin"" cycle only on LOW speed and it came out perfect. Highly recommend reading basics in manual b4 using, found very helpful to know all options and capabilities of this machine. Manual even offers helpful tricks like adding some towels to a load with a single item to help balance machine. I had no problem but it was good to know of that option. Add Garment feature is nice! Haven't tested built in sink yet.. Sink did not get in my way while removing items as some suggested. Love Self Clean feature-recommended to run every 2-3 months to keep odor, buildup & mold from inside machine! Lowes was great at explaining basics upon delivery too. Love the gray color! I accidentally put my liquid detergent in tub forgetting about dispenser- my cream sweater still came out great, so no worries if you do the same! But they recommend using the dispenser as it's made to dispense at appropriate times. Also says to add ""color safe"" bleach to detergent not bleach dispenser. I never knew that! Great manual!"
5.0,"""Surprise Christmas Purchase!""","My husband and I had a totally ancient washer and dryer set from when we first got together. This year we welcomed fraternal twins boys and with all of the extra loads of laundry the old set were really straining and were starting to die.We purchased this washer and it's matching dryer for the set. They are both good looking and fairly easy to use. The design is bigger on the outside than our old set but I can put two loads into the new washer and still have room left. It's huge in there. I was a bit concerned that one woman said her washer had ""exploded"" (her word, not mine), after reading online and looking at her pics I think it wasn't installed right and it was off balance. This washer needs to be level. It's important. Also, I see some people say it's loud but compared to our old washer this thing is super quiet so it's all relative.All in all, I believe this washer does a great job. It is definitely worth the money we paid for it and I would recommend it to a friend."
5.0,"""So far, so good.""","I agree with everyone's assessment that this is a quality washing machine with great features. However, I also agree that it is too noisy when pumping water out of the drum. I would think that Samsung can find a way to eliminate the horrible vibrating metal-on-metal noise which would make this machine nearly perfect."
1.0,"""Washing Machine Broke after 5 Cycles""","We were very excited to splurge a bit on this new washing machine. Unfortunately, after the fifth cycle, within 3 weeks of ownership, it began to leak significant amounts of water out the bottom during the wash cycle. Our new townhome now has water damage through to the next floor down.More disappointing is how Lowe's has handled this issue. They gave the local service provider our wrong address, which has led to a delay in the repair. The local service provider is unwilling to work on the machine because he would scratch up the platinum finish, though neither Lowes nor Samsung is willing to commit to replacing the machine, let alone repairing the damage to my new home. So now we've been a week without any resolution to the issue, and I've lost a day's worth of work just trying to manage the whole process."
4.0,"""Great features and good value but a bit loud.""","We just had the washer and dryer installed a few days ago and so far really enjoy them both. The sink in the washer comes in handy as we don't have an actual laundry room with a built in sink. We have already used it a few times. The washer comes with a lot of great features and is easy to use. Hit the power button, set the dial, a few options if you wish, and off you go. We also enjoy the ""geeky"" features of the washer. The small things such as the LED show when you power it on to the tune it plays when the cycle is complete, much better than the old ""BUZZZ"".My only complaint about the washer would be that it is a bit noisy. Our laundry closet is located right next to the living room and you have to turn the volume up on the TV to overcome the extra noise when the washer is on. If your laundry room is away from the family area, I doubt this would be a concern for you. Overall, great machine for the money!"
1.0,"""Broke 1 year & 1 week""","Broke 1 year & 1 week after delivery. Samsung refused to cover under warrantee & their customer service was terrible, putting us on hold for 45 minutes, & disconnecting our calls when we asked for a higher level. Will never buy Samsung again"
5.0,"""Love this machine!""","My only complaint is that the drum is so deep I need a stool to reach in to get the clothes out of the bottom. Upside, it hold probably DOUBLE what my old machine could. Nice job cleaning, haven't tried the top ""sink"" yet."
4.0,"""Great Washer""","We purchased this washer and dryer set on a recommendation from a friend. We had cabrio in the past and it was loud and started leaking, to repair was going to cost 700$+. So we decided to go through Lowes because they do free delivery and do repairs within a week. We bought the additional warranty because we use our w & d pretty heavily. The washer is much quieter than our cabrio was, our w&d; are off the kitchen and not far from where we watch tv - we used to have to turn the tv up when the washer was running but no longer need to do that. I like the electronic buttons and alarms. I have used the sink a lot, which comes in handy when hand washing items such as kids jerseys. I have run into ""unleveled"" loads when doing a blanket which has been frustrating, but this is on regular wash. I haven't tried on the blankets setting so perhaps this will make a difference. I am impressed with the size of the tub - because even with the sink, it holds more than my old washer. Overall, very pleased with this set! They are sharp looking appliances and seem to be very solid in function and durability. They actually take up less space than our old set also."
5.0,"""Worth the money""","The delivery guys were great. The set both washer and dryer up and made sure both were hooked up right and worked right. Leveled both and stayed until they and I were both satisfied both were set up and working great. I have used both washer and dryer several times now and love them both. I read the owners manual and have had no problems. My clothes are very clean and smell so good. I love the soak sink a lot. Very quiet. I did bed clothes yesterday and I could fit my king size quilt all pillow cases sheet and flat sheet in one load, was very impressed I didn't have to spend the whole day washing bedclothes. No complaints at this time!!!"
1.0,"""Not Impressed""","Purchased this washer with matching dryer less than a month ago. The FIRST washer was delivered 9/8/15. I used it immediately. At the end of the 1st load, I noticed a t-shirt had something around the collar. I assumed that maybe the shirt was older than I thought and was possibly starting to wear, maybe they were fibers coming out. (Didn't make sense, but, that was my 1st thought.) After washing the next load of darks, I noticed several items had some kind of residue on them. Once the machine was empty, I saw dirt in the bottom of the washer. I took a paper towel and wiped it out - thinking it must be some kind of fluke. When this happened a 3rd time, I started reading the owners manual, contacting Samsung, and Lowes. I have tried all of the suggestions - using the self cleaning option, wiping out the drum, loading items even in a donut shape, using the aqua jet to add more water, increasing the soil level to high, washing a smaller load, etc… However, I still experience this problem. I had a second machine delivered on Wednesday, again dirt was at the bottom of the washer when I washed clothes on Thursday. My daughters both play softball - I know that the dirt that is there is from the ball field. HOWEVER, I am not putting clothes in that are caked in dirt or visibly are covered in dirt. They basically look dusty, the dirt is the dirt that is trapped in the fiber of the clothes. I do believe there is not enough water running through the machine. I took a pair of shorts out that were wadded up after going through the wash - when I took them out there were parts of fabric that were still dry. I have had and used HE washers previously. I am very familiar with how they work, using the correct soap, loading the machine properly, etc... This is not normal. I was told today that they don't recommend these machines for farmers or construction workers. I can only imagine how dirty my clothes would be after washing if I washed with clothes that were really soiled. I am now waiting to speak to a manager to resolve this issue."
1.0,"""BIGGEST REGRET EVER!""","Bought the washer with the matching dryer for our new home back in June. We live in a sandy area and noticed in the first few weeks that the washer was not cleaning the cloths completely and leaving a dirt/sand wring in the bottom of the machine. Even after running the machine on an extra rinse cycle the cloths are still covered in sand, and I have to wipe it out after any loads that have clothes that were worn outside. My family came to visit in July and we went to the lake for the day. When we returned I did a load of laundry with all of our beach wear. I ended up having to wash the cloths out by hand to remove all the sand. I wish I would have called Lowes immediately to try and return this set and get my money back. The dryer is now leaking water and not drying a load without disconnecting the water supply. I have tried to contact Samsung a few times on the issues I am having but have not gotten any help. We also bought an entire kitchen set of Samsung appliances and we are having issues with the dishwasher leaking too."
5.0,"""Simply amazing!!!""","I could not be any happier with this purchase. After spending 3 days researching washers and dryers, this set really grabbed my attention. The built-in sink really is a gem. I go through a lot of hats at work, so a little pre-soak in the sink, dump into the bin, and I am all set. It really could not get much easier than that. The controls are very user friendly. In less than 5 min., I was able to have my 4 yro start the machine. A push of the power button, twist of the dial, and Start! In reference to other comments on the length of the cycles, the machine auto detects the load by weight and sets the length accordingly. As I do have many heavier clothes, I just use a smaller load on the Speed Wash setting and it is usually about 28-32 min. In comparison to a full load taking 1hr 36min., this is really a feature you cannot over look. The spin cycle is impressively quiet. I am so used to the spin cycle starting up and sounding like a turbo spooling up, not this machine. A small amount of noise on the ramp up, but at full speed is really quiet. The quietest machine I have ever had. This set is definitely a must have, and for the price, you kinda gotta. :)"
4.0,"""Great washer - if you're over 5'3""""","Sleek, stylish, gunmetal gray - what's not to like? The interior tub that almost hits the floor. I'm 5-2 (insert hobbit joke here), and I have a difficult time grabbing the bottom layer of cleaned clothes. Enter the recently purchased bbq tongs. With the assistance of my OXO tongs, I can empty the washer. Clothes are very clean, easy to read and understand dial, several settings for every cleaning occasion. Love the sink with the aqua jet to prewash clothes - tips the whole shebang right into the tub when you're done pretreating. Be prepared - the washer makes some really unwasher like noises, like ""meh meh"" and the sound of an Asian carp jumping out of the water (I'm not kidding here. I had to roust myself out of a perfectly comfortable lounger to make sure I wasn't washing a fish. Big splashy noise). Except for the assist from the tongs, perfectly happy with the overall performance and price, Lowe's was extremely helpful, after a new employee tried to redirect me to a different store to make the purchase, not realizing I could order it there and have it delivered. Great price too. Plays a very long music song. Waiting for Yanni to do a cover."
5.0,"""love it!""",Has so many settings you can do whatever kind of load you want. You'll never see another laundry mat unless there's just something so nasty you don't want it in your pretty washer.
1.0,"""MACHINE EXPLODED ON IT'S OWN- RUN AWAY!!""","We bought this machine at the beginning August 2015. After only 2 months of use, the machine literally exploded on it's own, sending shards of plastic and metal across my laundry room, flooded out the floor and threw water floor to ceiling in both the laundry room and out into the walls in the hallway outside of the laundry room, and the machine itself flew across the room and landed on it's side. It normally sits flush against the dryer, so you can see it moved itself at least a full 3 tiles across the room. We have two small children in addition to 4 pets who eat in the laundry room, and there very easily could have been permanent physical harm as a result of this machine. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MACHINE!! The worst part is that this machine is being marketed to target mothers, meanwhile it could have killed or severely injured either one of my children or myself, or our animals who all eat in this room as well, had they been present."
1.0,"""Made holes in my clothes""","Only used this washer a few times and realized it was making holes in my clothes. It ruined 2 shirts, a pair of jeans and a towel. We visited our local Lowe's store today and traded it back in for an LG. Loved the built in sink and thought it was going to be a great washer until I started looking my clothes over and found holes....one as big as the palm of my hand. Sorry, Samsung...back to the drawing board!"
1.0,"""worst purchase ever""",I bought this machine in July of 2015 it worked great for one month and was quiet. Then I started getting an unbalanced code and I would move the clothes around to balance them even though the machine says it self balances this took place for about a week maybe doing 3 loads. Then the basket was loud and hitting the walls of the machine and the spin motor quit. I called samsung it took about two weeks for a technician to show up he says its real bad and will have to send a truck to pick it up they picked it up one week later. they repaired it at they're shop it took almost 2 months and they replaced the basket the motor and clutch and board and wiring harness pretty much the entire machine. They bring it to my house it works for one week and is very loud beating and banging around again and is now broken again same problems. It takes the tech two weeks to show up he says it needs all the parts they replaced already he says its unrepairable. I call samsung again by the way it takes about an hour each time you call them. Samsung says its under review and they will call me in two days it was over a week and i had to call them and they told me they want to replace a few more items it takes another 3 weeks for technician to get parts and get back to my house he replaces it and still doesn't work. I call samsung again they say its under review and just to see how long it would take them to call me back two weeks went by and I had to call them and finally today 1/14/16 I get the go ahead to get my money back at lowes it has been a rough experience and customer service does not care how long you go without a washing machine. And now this long and messy story ends with me getting my money back on the washer and Lowes was disgusted enough to give me my money back on the dryer as well now I am the owner of a whirlpool washer and dryer
3.0,"""Samsung washer with sink""","Overall, not extremely happy.  The washer, operationally, does fine, but the lack of a separate spin cycle is weird.  The main complaint is that it simply does not get clothes as clean as our previous washers have.  Its not a detergent issue, i think the lack of an agitator has a lot to do with this."
1.0,"""Worst washer machine..""",Exactly 1 year old and broke..No power totally dead..No help from Samsung or Lowe's.. There's only 2 people in the house.. Wash clothes once a week.. Lowe's had no suggestions or help.. Totally done with Lowe's and Samsung products..
5.0,"""Nice washer""","Machine controls are user friendly and looks nice. It is pretty quiet during all cycles. The built-in sink is a nice idea and the sink bowl is ribbed and it doubles as a washboard for scrubbing on tough stains. The tub is spacious for your larger loads. It is pretty deep and a little more difficult to reach the bottom than your regular machines. The finish looks great with stainless steel panel on the front and the ""platinum"" (dark grey) paint on the sides and top surfaces. The feet are rubber and designed to keep the washer from ""walking"" when a load is unbalanced and shakes the washer. ( I haven't seen this washer wobble at all since we've had it )There are tunes that play when the cycle is done instead of the usual buzzer or beeping sound. Very happy with this washer so far."
1.0,"""Does not get my clothes clean.""",I have three boys so I need a good washer. This washing machine does not wash my clothes good. It doesn't even rinse my clothes good either. After a complete cycle there will be sand left in the bottom of the washer. Never did this happen with my old Roper.
5.0,"""Best Washer Ever!!!""",Love this washer! It makes virtually no noise and does an excellent job. Love the built in sink. Very user friendly!
5.0,"""Great Combo!!!""",We purchased this set a couple of weeks ago. I did extensive research on new machines as we were still using the set we purchased over 22 years ago. Obviously things have changed over the years. The reviews has us very apprehensive. Well after I figured out the settings and used them a few times... I was honestly looking for things to wash. The washer washes way faster than our old one and the dry dries in less than half of the time than the old one. We are very pleased with this set. If people would just use some common sense they are easy to use. No more fear here!!!
2.0,"""Activewash Basin handle broke""",We have had ours not even 8 months and the active wash basin handle that holds the basin to the lid broke off. Now we have to hold the basin up to load the washer. I will give credit it does wash well.
5.0,"""Fantastic Washer""","So far I have been loving this washing machine! With two small boys, I have my hands full when it comes to their laundry. The pre-wash built in sink has been really nice and easy for me. Unlike other reviews have stated, I have had no issues with clothes going unwashed, coming out dirty, and nothing has been damaged. This machine has been pretty quiet as far as these types of appliances go, and I am loving it."
3.0,"""pros and cons""","I have had this washer and dryer for 1 year now. it is stylish and works well. the negatives are. 1. the washing machine doesn't get that full of water. you open it and see it washing with enough water to fill in a glass. it cleans well it just makes me wonder how it can work with so little water. and you cant truly add more. you get what you get.  2. when washing large loads, it takes a long time to wash.. and dry. 3. the dryer tends to wad up comforters/blankets into a ball. so the outside is dry and inside is wet. it is annoying to have to keep going to the dryer to un-wad something. 4. the steam doesn't work that well. it makes your clothes damp , but the wrinkles are still there when they are dry.oh well"
1.0,"""Worse product ever""","I had this washer and dryer delivered, first the legs to the dryer was stripped out, delivery person told me to call Lowes. I called Lowes and was told since I didn't buy the extended warranty I would have to contact Samsung. And of course Samsung said it was a Lowes problem since they were responsible for the first 30 days. I finally got Lowes to take the legs off of the display in order to get them replaced.Samsung has terrible customer service, I called them about trying to level the washer up and they said it was self explanatory.The washer will not lock good have to spend at least 10 minutes to make sure it locks and it has come unlocked while running. I have put it on spin only and it ends up rinsing and spinning again. Doesn't like to just run the spin cycle."
1.0,"""SAMSUNG""","SAMSUNG HAS 32 MODELS RECALLED. I BOUGHT ONE 4 MONTHS AGO, HAS NOT WORKS FOR ALMOST 1 MONTH, 2 SERVICE GUYS, STILL NOT FIXED.  LOWES HAS NOT BEEN HELPFUL.  THEY WILL GIVE YOU A REBATE AFTER YOU PURCHASE A NEW ONE. I DONT TRUST AT THIS POINT I WOULD EVER BE ISSUED A REBATE."
1.0,"""Looks good but work  terrible""",This  particular  Samsung washer  does not   Clean very well. After the cycle in done. I still have  White detergen on my clothes. When the very  first Samsung washer  came out. It did not have the built in wash tub. With this one added the tub to cover the  bad  design.  When  I am washing a load. I can see that the  whole load is not Under water.
5.0,"""Surprisingly Great Washer""","This is my 1st top loader washer in many, many years. I've never been a fan of them and always preferred front loaders. So after checking out various models online at Lowe's...I needed one asap. Seeing them at the store made a better impression on me and I chose this one. Skeptical of the size being only 4.8 cu ft...vs my old one of 5.0 cu.ft. I wasn't sure if it would be big enough.Got it home and ""WOW""!!! It holds plenty more than I thought!!! It is quiet and efficient with water. Laundry comes out clean and smelling fresh. It didn't have some of the features of my old front loader had, but it works great for what I needed. It's deep enough to make me stretch in to reach the small items like socks. (I'm 5'10""). This is a really great washing machine....the special sink built in is a nice addition. It has plenty of ways to adjust the settings for whatever needs to be cleaned. I actually love this washer!!! WOW! Hope it lasts a long time with no issues down the road."
3.0,"""Ouch""","My husband and I had one of the recent recalled Samsung washers and we opted to replace it. The newer version of our model was not yet available, so my husband chose this one. This one has a smaller capacity and smaller width, but same lid heighth as our other one, so my husband thought it would be ok and went ahead and bought it for us. We thought the built-in sink sounded like a great idea, but we've discovered it's more of a nuisance. It's not removable for when it's not needed and we often hit our heads on it when trying to unload washed clothes to transfer them to the dryer. It also makes for a narrower window to fill the pull out drawer with detergent and fabric softener. We've scraped the backs of our hands more than once. Also, if you are height-challenged like me (I'm 5'1""), go ahead and buy a step stool. You'll never reach the clothes in the bottom without it. The front doesn't slope down like our recalled one did, so it's actually taller on front despite the same lid heighth. Needless to say, we're less than thrilled. I wish we had opted to repair our original washer."
1.0,"""Don't Buy This Washer Can't Clean Clothes!""","After 6 months I can say this washer can't clean clothes at all. I have a big family that needs clean stain free clothes. I've tried Max power, using the sink, OXY, soaking, rewashing etc... does not work. This washer and dare I say the Dryer of this set sucks and I am selling it on Craigslist for a deal!"
1.0,"""Wish I would have never purchased this machine...""","I bought this machine 11 months ago and it's already having to be repaired..A repairman has been to my home 3 times in the past 2 weeks trying to fix it but hasn't been able to do so..It's currently under review to see if it can even be repaired..I haven't been happy with this machine for quite some time.It doesn't clean or rinse well..You can't set the water level...Our clothes come out dingy. It twists the jeans up so badly that it's almost like pulling ropes out of the machine..It's ripped holes in my mattress protectors and tears the rubber backing off of my bathroom rugs..And, if you're short, you won't be able to reach the bottom of the barrel without standing on a step stool or use something to fish the small items out..If you decide do buy this machine after all, I would definitely buy the extended warranty.."
1.0,"""Samsung Washer""",I wish I could give this less than one star. It uses so little water that I have to wash many things three times to get them clean. In addition it uses three times as much electricity than my old 20 year old Maytag.
1.0,"""Do not buy""","I purchased this about a month before it was recalled, still fighting with Samsung about that... IF you purchase this as a set with the matching dryer, and it is recalled, they will give you about $200 less than you paid a month before for the unit to replace it with another samsung, or $350 less to replace it with another brand (which is what I wanted to do). But they will give you exactly $0.00 for the Dryer that matches! So if you like your set to match, get over it! Apart from the recall, the machine fails to properly spin out even the smallest of blankets and throws an error code, and then the blanket is too wet and too heavy for the dryer, so it throws its own error code. I would not recommend my worst enemy buy this thing."
1.0,"""Never buying Samsung again!""","Just bought this washer this July. Samsung placed a recall on washer. Nobody local will repair the Samsung. We are going on 5 weeks of issues. Not related to the recall we had a issue with the cycles not ending. Just fills, washes, drains, and restarts filling again over and over.  A repair man came from hours away to repair recall and our cycle issue as well.  He left after doing his job without even running a cycle.  So I go to wash a load. The entire load of water from the wash drained out onto our floors filling our laundry room, under the walls, and out onto our hardwood floors.  Now the repair man can't come for another week! I'm sure we will have water damage. Getting Samsung to actually help us and not just give us another ""ticket number"" has been a nightmare.  Dealing with Samsung transferring us and transferring us to different departments and holding for over an hour to be ""disconnected"" on multiple times.  Will be going with a Maytag next time."
1.0,"""Junk""","Bought this washer Jan 3rd.  Arrived at the store Jan 9th.  Had to wait til Jan 14th for delivery.  Morning of delivery got a call from the delivery company that they had to push back delivery to between 6 and 8. PM.  They finally arrive at 6:30 PM.  Hooked up the washer and completed the install procedures.  Tried to do a test load, but the agitator makes a horrible grinding noise and the washer drum moves very slowly.  Looked up the troubleshooting guide in the owners Manuel.  The problem isn't covered and there is no error code.  Called the 1-800 number for Samsung and described the problem to the broken English speaking support person.  She could only tell me that the washer is not part of the massive recall that they are in the middle of.  Strange that the Lowes salesman neglected to mention that.  Support person can offer no help and told me to call them back on Monday.  Looked up the problem on the internet and it appears that either the drum clutch, drum bearings, or the main board are shot.  Straight from the factory, only owned the thing for an hour and not a single load of laundry washed and this thing requires major repair.  Beware of buying a Samsung product.  First their cellular phones blow up, then their top loading washers blow their tops and required massive recalls but only after consumer outrage."
4.0,,This washer is huge. I like it but if you are shorter than 5'6 you may not be able to reach the bottom of washer tub easily. Keep that in mind and before purchasing make sure you can reach your clothes in the bottom of the washer. That is my only negative. I'm 5'6 and I have to get on tippy toes and stretch to reach in. I love that I can fit my king size comforter in it!
5.0,"""Remove the Sink!""","I've had this machine about a year, no complaints.  Two things:1. This model has been recalled due to lid blowing off under certain (unusual) conditions. Make sure the one you get has been modified (it's a simple fix)2. The sink is a dumb gimmick.  Once you tire of banging your head here is how to easily remove (see photo)."
2.0,"""Soap Dispenser Drawer Hits Activewash Sink""","The washer is great. The issue is totally with the soap dispenser/softener drawer. The soap drawer front protrudes below the top of the activewash sink. One would think the soap dispenser drawer would be able to be opened over top of the sink, if the sink is in the ""down"" (usable) position. This is NOT the case. Samsung indicates the design is that the sink MUST be in the UP position with the lid open and the soap drawer pulled out below the sink. This is very uncomfortable and due to the shape of the sink, does NOT give a clear area to pour liquid detergent into the dispenser from a retail soap container. Not a good design."
2.0,"""Not impressed""","Bought this along with the matching dryer.  They look nice but that's where it ends.  This machine and the dryer are both noisy.

3.0,"""Disappointed""","This was my dream washing machine. I was able to buy due to a steep discount. So far it's been an ok purchase. I foster dogs so I need a machine that dumps loads of water and agitates well, and this machine is not it. I should have realized that since it's High Efficiency but had never used an HE machine before. There is no agitator which is nice for loading/unloading but I don't think it gets clothes as clean.The tub gets off balance easily and the machine stops until you redistribute the load. I don't use hot water because the faucet leaks (so faucet is turned off). The machine automatically selects hot or warm water on some settings, and I have to completely unplug the washer to get it to reset so I can take it off the hot/warm setting. The top locks in place so adding clothes means you have to pause the wash cycle.It does have several settings and has a very large tub, but don't expect everything to get clean on every wash."
1.0,"""Worst washer I've ever owned!""","As a mother of 4 I consider myself a laundry pro. This is hands down, the absolute WORST washing machine I've ever owned. It just doesn't clean your clothes! I bought it for the high reviews and the laundry tub option (since we have a laundry closet)and it has been nothing but a problem. I've had service on it 3 times since I purchased it LAST December of 2015 all with the same result, filthy grimy clothes. At this stage in the game I'm disconnecting this unit and putting it in the garage while I fight with Samsung to get every penny of my money back. Save yourself the headache and buy just about any other brand OTHER than Samsung! Because of all of this runaround I'm definitely going to think twice before I put another dollar into Samsung's pocket!"
1.0,"""RESEARCH BEFORE YOU BUY""","From day 1 our washing machine gave us trouble. we was thinking that we added to many cloths, so we tried fewer. the spin bowel seems broke, makes extremely loud noise, tangle any and all types of wear, we tries to balance it but thats not the problem, it was quiet the first time we washed in it but there after, it makes so much noise you would think someone is banging a piece of wood on the inside. I WISHED I WOULD HAVE RESEARCHED AND READ ALL REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING. Now, we are stuck with this VERY BAD PRODUCT. DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG... Wish I could give a 0 star.Note: all CUSTOMERS BAD REVIEWS are at bottom and ALLLLLLL GOOD ONES ARE AT TOP. JUST KEEP READING!!!"
1.0,"""Check out Samsunservice in your area before buying""",The low rating is NOT for the washer; it is for the Samsung service.  Samsung repurposed their cable television tv repair service division (ditectv) to repair washers.  The service guys hate doing washers & it showed in their work.  Don't buy Samsung products if you think you will someday need to have the equipment serviced. You will regret it.  I do.  my entire laundry room was flooded by a Directv guy who hated his new responsibilities.
1.0,"""Pretty but not long lasting.""","I purchased this set of matching washer and dryer when my last GE washer was deemed by Lowes and was paid. Went ahead and purchased the whole set instead of just a washer so it could match. It was purchased 8/2015. A few months ago a major recall was done on it. It was serviced and fixed. Last week it went out again and now its been deemed and not repairable! Very frustrating because am hoping to find the same one or same color so it can still match the dryer. Problem is, I will get the full refund of what I paid but its now $100 more expensive then a year and a half ago plus I'll have to spend again the $140 for the 5 year warranty. Why cant I just have the same one replaced instead of having to wait for a store gift card that will take about 10 days? Looks like I'll be out of a washer for 3 weeks easily."
1.0,"""Worst Washing Machine Ever!""","We purchased this washer/dryer set from Samsung about a month ago and have already returned it to Lowe's and are waiting for our LG replacement washer and dryer.This machine is horrible and has ruined several expensive pieces of clothing. What happens is that there is a sensor that detects how big the load is and determines how much water is needed to wash the load. But what our machine did was underfill the drum so there were articles of clothing lying on top of the load. There isn't an agitator so parts of the clothing on top never got submerged and washed. In fact, when we transferred the load to the dryer we noticed that some of the clothing items never even got wet at all, let alone washed.Here is the worst part! The machine dumps in the bleach and the detergent on top of the clothes and so the bleach just sat there on our clothes and ruined several items - an expensive designer pajama set of my husband's, towels, and sheets just to name a few of the items. Huge splotches of bleach on the clothes. I would estimate this machine ruined about $500 worth of our items.Can't wait to get rid of this washer!"
2.0,"""How do it work?""","Our old washer worked fine but like most people that have front loaders, mildew around door was a constant issue. Clothes from this washer seemed a bit dingier but ok. However, our son who works outside in steamy NC was having to cage clothes three times a day because of odor buildup. Being a mechanical savant he asked me what really cleans the clothes in this washer. I did not have an answer. The old front loader tumbled the clothes and the top loader before that had an agitator. This one just has a big empty drum? My best guess is that it it just repeatedly soaks the clothes and spins the water out. Maybe the little tub on top is to hand wash all clothes before loading?"
1.0,"""READ BEFORE BUYING ANY APPLIANCES FROM EDGEWOOD!""","DISCLAIMER: I'm posting this bad review to multiple appliances for sale here, as the issue is with appliance delivery and installation, and the lack of customer service at the Edgewood ATL store, and not necessarily the washer I bought.Purchased a top loading washer for $400. Took a half day off of work to receive delivery within the 4hr window specified. Received an auto-call at the time my washer was to arrive that informed me that the delivery would be late. Arranged for someone else to pick my kids up from school so I wouldn't miss the delivery. Then, at the end of the second delivery window time, another automated call informs me that the delivery will be postponed until tomorrow. So, I didn't need to take off of work, or arrange for anyone else to pick up my kids... ok. They tell me they'll call and inform me what time to expect delivery the next day. So, after I call the delivery people because they didn't bother to call me as they said they would, I find out what I need to take off of work AGAIN the next day. Luckily, I had a come down with the flu and needed to call out anyhow the next day.The man shows up the next day, and I'm burning with fever, shivering and just out of it. I think, surely I don't have to oversee this, surely he'll do the job he was supposed to do? Wrong. He pulls out washer and dryer to get to the hook-ups, and installs new washer leaving it outside of my laundry nook, so that in order to get everything back into the laundry nook, I will have to unhook it all, push the dryer back in, hook it back up and push washer in. But even that is complicated by the way he ran the water and drainage hoses through the laundry room shelving. And if that wasn't enough, he apparently had taken the time to move the dryer over so that it's arranged dryer first and washer second, but also, so that my dryer door buts up against the frame of the laundry nook, so you can't open the door all the way. It's as if he asked himself at every point of the installation what the most logical thing to was, and then did the opposite. My fault, lesson learned, I should have stood over him the whole time and watched his every move, then when time to sign off I should have had him show me exactly what he had done before signing off. Really didn't think that was necessary, and wasn't up for it as I felt like I was about to die. Lesson learned.I called Lowes to tell them that I was not at all satisfied and that they needed to come back out and fix it. They told me they'd call the delivery folks and see when they could get to me. I told that wasn't an option, and that they needed to come back out now. I asked to speak with the STORE MANAGER and received a call back from a DEPT MANAGER, who told me not only that they would get to me when they could, but that Lowes now outsources their delivery and installation to a 3rd party vendor, and that she didn't have any control over when they could get there. I work in the service industry, and we outsource several 3rd party vendors to complete our service, and if our 3rd party vendors are not doing their job, they here from us and correct, or we find someone else to do that job. And we NEVER would tell a customer that ""it's their fault and there's nothing we can do"" or use the vendor as a scapegoat. I asked again when someone would be coming to fix the installation TODAY, and she repeatedly told me that they're doing their best to fix things in a reasonable time-frame. And I repeatedly told her that I didn't think I was being unreasonable to ask them to fix something that should have been completed yesterday.I gave up on Lowes taking responsibility for anything and resolved to fix it myself.Upon getting washer and dryer units into the right spot, I figured out why the delivery guy went out of his way to put things in the wrong place: because the drainage hose wasn't long enough. I called the store back and told them this, and they inform me that they don't even carry an extension for the drainage tube, and once again reinforced just how little they cared to try to fix anything.I ended up going several more days without a washer as I ordered my own new hose extension, put things in the right spot so that they were accessible, and unhooked and re-hooked-up the water and drainage so that it wasn't tied into my laundry shelving. I also wrote Lowes several angry emails to their corporate customer service, and received a few automated emails about how sorry they were, and how someone would be reaching out to me. About a week goes by and I hear from no one, respond to one of the customer care emails saying ""still haven't heard from anyone"" and then 3-4 days later get a call in the middle of the afternoon (even though I specified mornings as being the best time to call) from someone at Lowes (not even the store manager) and wasn't able to talk because I was busy at work. I just laughed and said thanks for nothing, I've fixed it myself.Buy appliances here at your own risk. This was flubbed at EVERY turn, and management from the top down (well, I never got to speak to the store manager, so I don't really know) made it clear that they weren't going to do anything to fix it. I take that back, I was able to run my credit card and pay them $400 with no issues, after that, everything was completely flubbed. The delivery service is a complete joke, and as the department manager informed me, they're just going to give as much effort as they want to, and there are no consequences if they don't do their job. But then, I did only spend $400 there? ha!Buyer beware, if everything doesn't work out just as it should, I wouldn't expect much in the way of help. I plan to drive 20 minutes out of the way to go to the other (orange) home supply store in midtown for everything."

The clothes are easy to load and really come out clean and with minimal water in them. The tub is deep, so sometimes small items are a little difficult to retrieve for those of us who are a little height-challenged (5'2""), but not impossible. The machine is a louder than I expected, but not too noisy. The biggest drawbacks for me are the pre-soak sink and detergent dispenser. I like the built-in sink and have used it several times. It is very convenient, but it would be MUCH better if the sink was built to be easily detachable from the lid. When reaching into the bottom of the tub, it is difficult to not hit my head on the sink. The detergent dispenser is nearly inaccessible due to the sink, and the dispenser tray cannot be accessed with the sink down. I almost need a funnel to get the liquid detergent into the tray because of the sink. The sink also makes it impossible to see inside the washer when it is running, so why have an see-through lid?? Overall, I like the machine and the job of getting clothes clean is done to my complete satisfaction which would be a 5 had it not been for the issues mentioned above, so I rated the washer a 4."

Also, I liked how big the inside was, you can fit a lot of clothes in it, however, when you do a big load it often stops half way through saying its ""Ub"" which is unbalanced. Its really frustrating when you're trying to get all your chores done in a certain time frame and you find out your washer quit half way through the cycle."

The washer automatically detects the load to fill the correct amount of water and levels the load so it does not go off balance (unlike my front loader always did). Of course it's a bit noisy but so was my front loader. If you want total quiet, buy something else. If you want a very good quality washer for the money, buy this one."

No matter how full the load has been, the dryer has managed to dry it all the way through. * It has a sweet little singing alarm (chime-sounding) that goes off when the laundry is done. This can be a pro or a con - however, it can be turned off if you don't like it, so I call that a pro. * I love being able to watch my laundry as it's drying. It's silly, but it's fun!* You can turn the light on inside the dryer so you can watch it, even in the dark. * Lots of options for settings.  Cons: *The chiming alarm can be a bit annoying, but it's easy to turn off I'm sure there's more, but for as new as it is and for how much I've used it, I love it."

3.0,"""Like Dryer, but I am somewhat disappointed in it overall.""","Dryer was only 1 year old when it started making this high pitched squeal. Repair was for bearings that were located under the drum. The lint sensor light to indicate a crimp or lint caught in the out going hose comes on after doing 2 loads of laundry at a time, even though I clean lint filter after every load and vacuum out lint compartment in dryer. I also vacuum out hose after several loads. Sensor has been replaced and it continues to light up when I know it is all clear. I do like the settings for wrinkle release, refresh, special towel setting and the steam sanitize. Rarely do I have to iron anymore!"
5.0,"""Great Purchase""","After my washer went out on me, I had to go get a new one last minute. The samsung top load has a big barrel that fits a bigger load than my last washer which is so helpful and a lot less loads to wash. The time feature that tells of how long the load takes and is remaining is also a great feature. I would totally recommend this product to a friend."
5.0,"""Remarkable set""","I received the washer and dryer as a set last summer. I waited 9 months to write my review to ensure I would still be as happy with the set as I was when my son purchased them for me. This washer is a dream to use. The best thing is the integrated washboard in the lid. I never thought I would use this feature, but found I use it almost daily from hand washing delicates to scrubbing stained rags used to clean the cars. It has held up through rinsing dirty shoes and pre-treating stains, to soaking silk lingerie. The only bad thing about the integrated sink is that the water isn't hot enough.I could say that it is too deep to reach bottom, but that is because I am short. This was solved by my son building me a step to climb up and reach into the tub. If the tub was any smaller, I would not be able to wash the KING quilts with ease!"

This machine is easy to use and the instructions are even better to understand. My last washer was a front loader that only lasted for eight years or so I have had problems with it being control board going out, draining not properly, clothes not being cleaned, and the dispenser not working and being cracked. the front loader hangs on to the old water that smelled and left a smell on the clothes. I was done with this. So I made the decision to purchase a new washer. I did my research and decided to go and look at them what I found was this washer it had everything I wanted and more. This was the best value for my money. I bought the same day took it home hooked it up which was easy to do. Started my laundry and found out I just love this washer! I am very happy with my product from Samsung. In the future if I need any other products I will more than likely choose Samsung. Thank you for making a wonderful product. All I can say top loaders are the way to go now."

5.0,"""Clothes do not dry""",Bought for wrinkle and steam features. Washed four light weight Capri pants and light weight shirts and am on fifth 20 min cycle of wrinkle guard feature and still beyond even what can be considered damp.

5.0,"""Top Loader with A LOT of room!""","I have had this product for about a week and I LOVE the design, features and performance. The wash drum is HUGE-4.8cf. The only concern is when I use HOT setting for wash of towels/linens, condensation/steam filters out onto the control button section; however I am not concerned as these button are sealed and the condensation is more of an annoyance than problem. I am at this point 100% happy with the purchase of this washer!"

5.0,"""Large Capacity, Intelligent, & Unexpected Features""","I bought this washer without even seeing it in the store simply because I loved the one I had in my last house. This one is even better. The activewash is a really great feature. I don't have a slop sink/utility basin, so this is perfect for being able to soak & treat stains on clothing. Just about every parent will wish they had this. The capacity is amazing, and I can wash a large, fluffy comforter and still have room for several bath towels. It does a great job of cleaning clothes, and the fact that there isn't an agitator spindle helps keep from tearing delicate garments. I highly recommend this washer."

4.0,"""Out with the Old!""","We purchased this set about a month ago. Our past experience with washers and dryers were using the low end brand name types. We were able to have enough in the budget to buy this set (gas dryer version) when it was on sale. I have read other reviews saying this is a loud set. It is far from loud, quite quiet in fact, and the tones for the end of cycle are pleasing to the ears versus the old aaaaaaarrrrrr! The washer and dryer are required to be installed level, and the washer has a calibration procedure to be completed after initial installation. The quality of washes and drying cycles is remarkable. Clothes come out feeling completely different, much softer compared to the 15 year old junker set. The durability of this set remains to be seen, we did purchase the 5 year protection plan since these units are much more electronic than our dinosaur models. I have read many negative reviews about noise, for Pete's sake its a machine and its going to make noise, level and calibrated is key I think. The sink works nicely since we have no utility sink, and it does not get in the way too much. For now we are content, and with the platinum color, I can raise my pinky as I drink my favorite adult beverage."

The dispenser where you put the fabric softener doesn't hold the liquid, it just spills it right into the load as soon as I put it in. I was also told that it wold help water and energy usage and neither one of those bills changed at all for me."
4.0,"""Nice machine.""","Giving this product 4 stars... it's super quiet, looks nice, the wash tub is great especially if you have kids and need to treat stains, only thing I don't like the place where you put your detergent is inside and the wash tub is in the way when you try to pour your detergent from the cup, and it's hard for short ppl to reach into this tub with the wash tub in the way. Other than that, the product is GREAT! And the price is great too."

4.0,"""Out with the Old!""","We purchased this set about a month ago. Our past experience with washers and dryers were using the low end brand name types. We were able to have enough in the budget to buy this set (gas dryer version) when it was on sale. I have read other reviews saying this is a loud set. It is far from loud, quite quiet in fact, and the tones for the end of cycle are pleasing to the ears versus the old aaaaaaarrrrrr! The washer and dryer are required to be installed level, and the washer has a calibration procedure to be completed after initial installation. The quality of washes and drying cycles is remarkable. Clothes come out feeling completely different, much softer compared to the 15 year old junker set. The durability of this set remains to be seen, we did purchase the 5 year protection plan since these units are much more electronic than our dinosaur models. I have read many negative reviews about noise, for Pete's sake its a machine and its going to make noise, level and calibrated is key I think. The sink works nicely since we have no utility sink, and it does not get in the way too much. For now we are content, and with the platinum color, I can raise my pinky as I drink my favorite adult beverage."

I love that you can choose the level of dryness you want as well as the wrinkle release feature. I was skeptical until I used it but now i am sold on it - MUCH better than ironing! I also like the steam feature. There is really nothing that I don't love about this dryer. It is so much better than any other I have owned! I highly recommend it if you want and like ""bells and whistles""n your appliances. These are worth the expense."

5.0,"""Love it!""","Just purchased for my new house, and am elated with all the features compared to my 15yo model I upgraded from. The presets to select the kind of laundry are a real time-saver. I love how it detects the load size to use the appropriate amount of water automatically, and auto-balances itself. My laundry time has been cut in half."
5.0,"""Big drum, lots of options""",I appreciate this machine's many features and options for washes. The one downside is the pretreating sink is slightly in the way when loading wanting solution. It's not a big enough inconvenience to not have the pretreating sink though... Because that feature is really neat!
5.0,"""Love it""","Love the way the washer truly runs its self. Washers the cloths excellent. the build-in-sink is very handy, since we have no sink nearby the laundry room. It has made the washer much easier and seem like we are not even washer its so easy. It does have more then enough bells and whistling for the price we payed for. They all work very beautifully."

5.0,"""Washer perfect for a Family of 4""",So far we've owned this top load washer for 1 week after our old washer of 7 years bit the dust. So far this washer has did more loads of laundry in one day compared to 2 days of laundry with the older washer.I was a bit worried when I read all the reviews about similar washer blowing up but so far no problems here. After checking out Consumer Reports they recommend these model with high remarks.I do admit I didn't realize these top load washer take an average of one hour to do one load but keep in mind that one load is very large.
5.0,"""Great dryer to match my washer""","WA52J8700AP/A2 Platinum Energy Star dryerThis dryer is loaded with cycle options, but is very easy to operate. I just select the cycle that describes the type of laundry I've put in and then hit the ""start"" button.I had a pretty mixed and large load, and everything came out perfectly dried. The dryer automatically adjusts the temperature and time to fit the load and measures the dampness as well to get clothes just dry enough.There is a steam option which I have not tried, except to see if it worked - and it did - that will sanitize your laundry, reduce odors and help to remove wrinkles. It was simple to hook up the steam connection with the enclosed adapter, but you will have to purchase a water hose to complete the hook up. You also have to purchase the electrical connection that fits the outlet in your home.The door is reversible, and that was a fairly simple operation although the directions were not 100% clear. It only took me a few minutes to figure it out and now the door swings out the correct way to match where my washer is located.Only had this about a week now, but it's working great with no problems at all. It has a feature to remind you when to clean out the lint filter, which I usually forgot to do with the old dryer. The energy star rating ensures that I will be saving on my electric bill for what I hope is many years to come."

I recently renovated my laundry area and decided to upgrade both appliances. I couldn't have made a better choice with this Washer. Its quite, efficient and gets the job down in a shorter amount of time. The washer also have the AquaJet and Active Wash features they are definitely worth the added expense.

Around the same time, the dryer intermittently stop heating. We could have 1 out of 10 loads without being dried. The grinding noise was fixed by a technician under warranty but the heating issue was not as it was difficult to reproduce. Here we are four months later with no warranty and with a dryer that totally stopped heating. It got really bad as it did not dry the load in it and there was another being washed meanwhile. Time to junk it just after 13 months of operation. Really disappointing."

5.0,"""Very pleased""",After having so many issues with top load washers that had agitators this washer has been a pleasant change and I like the large capacity that accommodates bedding. I am very pleased with this product and if not for room to grow I would have given all areas and excellent rating.
5.0,"""Great Features with large capacity""","In addition to the regular settings, this machine has refresh, wrinkle away, and steam sanitize. We like the steam sanitize setting expecially for bedding and pillows, and the wrinkle away foritems like skirts and dress shirts."
5.0,"""Design issue""",Washer functions great. The main issue which I think the designers need to address is the detergent and fabric softener dispenser location. Hard to add products and water remains in the dispensers. Worry about damage if you forget to slide dispensers back in prior to closing the lid.
1.0,"""Recalled""","Bought this washer in September 2016, and it was recalled in November 2016. Wonder if Lowes will honor a full refund?"
5.0,"""New Clothes Washer""","Recently purchased the Samsung clothes washer, many nice features, good display panel. Very quiet and smooth running. One drawback for shorter people is reaching to the bottom of the tub for items such as socks or small towels. Otherwise a very nice machine. Definitely recommend"
1.0,"""Samsung does not stand behind their warranty""","The washer works fine. But do not believe that Samsung will honor their warranty. The top lid release mechanism broke at one of the two hinge points (see photo attached). It was used twice during the 6 months after purchase. Clearly a part defect (material, design, or manufacture). Dispatched service tech immediately concluded upon inspection that the part was damaged (duh!) and not under warranty??  He submitted his photo of the affected area (which showed nothing relevant) to Samsung management. Their conclusion … the part was damaged. (Double duh!!) My photo is below."
5.0,"""Everything plus more""","This washer has everything you could want plus more. It takes the guess work out of a lot of your different types of loads by selecting water temp, soil level, and spin level for you. Plus the activewash is awesome! Love it!"
5.0,"""This product is amazing""",I love my wash machine I love that they have the built-in sink to it is super awesome for baby clothes that have milk spit up on it or anything that really needs to soak for a while before it's washed if you haven't tried this washer or bought it yet you should definitely invest in it. I also love this washer because my husband is an active-duty Soldier and his uniforms are always disgusting and I put he detergent on it let it do its work

5.0,"""Fantastic Dryer""","I've had this for a couple weeks now and it is wonderful. The controls are very easy to use and the huge capacity easily dries nicely. Granted the dry it replaced was 20+ years old, comparing this model to others in the store was a no-brainer. Great price, Samsung reliability, can't beat it."
5.0,"""This product is user friendy""",My Samsung washer and dryer were installed yesterday. I have done several loads and have used owners manuals several times to understand features.
5.0,"""TOP QUALITY AT COMPETITIVE PRICES""",I HAVE BEEN A LONGTIME FAN OF SAMSUNG TV'S AND NOW I CAN ADD WASHERS AND DRYERS TO THAT LIST OF HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL AND VERY RELIABLE PRODUCTS. I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THESE TO PRODUCT LINES AND WILL CONSIDER OTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE.
5.0,"""Perfect""",Replaced a 10 year old washer. This one is so much more advanced & does a great job. Best part is the large tub size. Also very very quiet.
5.0,"""Great Washer""","I went from a front loading washing machine to this and I love my new washer. I thought that my old washer was doing a great job until I washed my first load of clothes with my new Samsung washer. I was shocked when I saw how dirty my clothes actually were. I really thought my old washer was great, not anymore. I could not be happier with my new Samsung Washer. The choice of cycles is way beyond what my old washer had. The machine itself is much more quieter than my front loading machine. I can wash more clothes at one time than before. I am so glad that I made the switch."
5.0,"""This product has great features""",It dries fast! The steam feature is awesome. All the features it has are great.
4.0,"""Amazing machine""","I went looking for a dryer with a budget in mind, but when I found this one I knew I paying a little more was going to be worth it. I have not been disappointed (1 month of use). For one, I constantly leave my clothes in the dryer only to have to, typically rewash and dry them because I hate ironing. You can set this baby to keep spinning until you remember to grab your laundry. However, one should never forget because the song that plays when the drying is done is long and obnoxious like they were trying to over compensate for something--just be you Samsung. It's all good. To further assist with my hated of ironing is the wrinkle away steam. I use this a lot. Sometimes just because. Oh, and this dryer dries stuff real nice if you want it."

5.0,"""Great Dryer, including the steam function, saves on dry cleaning""","Have used this dryer for over one year, and never an issue. Always dries the clothes automatically and stops when they are dry by sensor. The steam function is great to freshen anything when your time restricted or don't want to risk the piece in the washer. Holds up well, loaded with features and extra large capacity."
4.0,"""Fantastic Product""",This is a great product that looks as good as it performs.

5.0,"""Great""",Had a cheap washer that was not cleaning our clothes now they are cleaner then ever. Great buy and works grear
4.0,"""So far so good""","We bought this model for one reason only, the wash basin! Have had it only a couple of weeks but so far its pretty cool, like the easy access water for soaking or cleaning something separate and easy dump right into the washer. Only draw back is that you cant really watch the clothes washing because the basket is in the way and not removable."
5.0,"""Good dryer but has a few issues.""","I empty the lint trap after every load but there is always lint in the bottom of the trap, under the screen. It doesn't do a good job of catching the lint. At times the dryer will not get the entire load dry, using the sensor dry function. On large loads, I typically have to remove part of the load and turn it back on the dry the rest of it. Other than that, it's great."
5.0,"""Washer Performs to High Expectations""",The WA7770 washer performs very well. Absolutely no issues or problems have been experienced. Have never utilized the ActiveWash feature and cannot report on that.

5.0,"""This product is a great space-saver!""",My wife and I just purchased our brand new Samsung top-loading active washer and we love it!! It was delivered today and it did not take long for the delivery men to set it up. We love how compact it is and how perfectly it fit in to the existing space where our old washer was. It operates very quietly compared to our old washer and it has a lot of bells and whistles on it. We recommend this product to anyone who is in the market to buy a new washer. We can not wait to purchase the matching dryer!
5.0,"""Very satisfied""","We have had this dryer now for a month and are loving it! I am a mom of 4 boys and used to have to do at least a load of laundry every day with my old washer/dryers, but our new Samsung washer/dryer have cut that load in half! This dryer holds so much clothes, I am only doing laundry about 3 days a week now instead. The moisture sensors on this machine are fantastic too because I have yet to have to start up a load again because some of the clothes are still damp. This dryer is very efficient and gets everything completely dry. The one and only minor default this dryer has is the lint trap isn't the easiest to clean out, but it's something I have already figured out and gotten used to."
5.0,"""Home run washer""","Have been using this washer for a month. It is large, cleans very well. Quiet, and can handle king size bedding. Super impressed."
5.0,"""Pleasantly Surprised""","Read most of the reviews....seemed most reviewers had issues with low water, not cleaning well, no agitator. Well, we did not experience these problems. Went through the preliminary start up. My wife loves it!"
5.0,"""Great dryer""",We have had the dryer for about a month now and am pretty confident in recommending it to others. Coming from a Gas dryer setup I was actually very impressed with the performance of this dryer. I have in the past had electric dryers that didn't dry the clothes with our running them through multiple times. This has not had that issue. There are no cons that I can think of.
5.0,"""great unit""","I replaced my old Samsung on the recall that is going on , with the rebate from Samsung,  it was a no brainier , great unit, quiet, excellent washer , I am stuck on Samsung units  spoiled , also unit was on sale at the time , great,"
4.0,"""This product does everything but load the dryer""","Just had this washer delivered a couple of days ago and have had it running ever since. The clothes come out almost dry and require little time in the dryer. The great part is all I have to do is put the clothes in the washer and it does all the adjustments by itself. An added feature, it plays a little tune when it is finished instead of just a beep, beep, beep."
5.0,"""Samsung Washer""",I had a Samsung washer and liked it so I bought another one. It has great features and does a good job of cleaning my clothes. Very good machines.
5.0,"""This washer is amazing""","I love this washer, the clothes come out smelling so clean and fresh and the washer is so quiet except on high spin. I love all the neat cycles and I love the appearance of the washer, it is a beautiful appliance as all of my other Samsung products and that is many. I love the bright lights as well and the chimes, much better than the bells and ringers on other brands"
1.0,"""This product is clearly disappointing.""","We just got our new washer and dryer installed. It was very disappointing to learn that the tub of the washer is designed so low that it is very difficult to get the wet clothes out and put them in the washer. Since my husband and I are elderly, this is a challenge to reach down to get the clothes. With back problems, we can see that the challenge will continue to be a problem. It is not good for the clothing, plus it makes the wash day cycle much longer -- not to mention that the reach is strenuous. Please advise if there is some answer to this problem. We presently have a Samsung TV, DVD, and Microwave."

I love that it senses the level of wetness the clothes are and keeps drying past set time if my bulky load doesn't get dry the first 40 minutes. It's nice to not come back to a soaking wet load of clothes just sitting there! It dried my king size comforter in 1hr! Plus the color is beautiful I just love looking at my new set :)"

1.0,"""Dissatisfied with Samsung""","We recently received a recall notice on a machine like this. Apparently the top of this machine can fly off when washing bedding or other heavy materials. The options for fixing include drilling through the top to add a bracket or to buy a new machine and receive a rebate (6 to 8 weeks) after purchase. The rebate is based upon the type machine that you buy. You will receive a little more if you buy Samsung again. The rebate will not cover the cost of a new machine. I talked to a customer service rep and he acknowledged the rebate was not adequate and he could not help me any more. I asked to talk to someone else and said that could have someone call me back in 3 to 7 business days. They seem to have quite a few people to call back. Whatever you do, do not buy Samsung."
4.0,"""Recall replacement washer""","This washer came to our home as part of an exchange after the massive recall on top loading Samsung washers.  Ironically, out recalled washer was better.   This basically works the same, but is much louder than our previous washer."
1.0,"""Never again - regret purchase""","Closest support tech is in Rochester,NY. This model had a safety issue recall The solution to resolve the safety issue caused machine to not work. Took 8 weeks to do recall option, then went two weeks without use of machine - called Samsung to request a tech - so far another 3 weeks without a response. Machine now broke , lid does not close automatically. Will never purchase a Samsung product again!"

3.0,"""Good features but VERY noisy""","We have had this washer only few days and it works fine, but it's loud in parts of cycles. It's surprisingly much louder than the ancient Maytag we replaced it with. Lowes delivery did not level it when they installed it, didn't even try. So I had to deal with that myself, not hard to do but that should have been apart of the delivery set up. It's in the manual as one the first things to do."
2.0,"""Safety Recall""",Purchased this washer from Lowe's in August 2016 along with matching dryer to put in a house I was having remodeled. Bought it before I needed it due to $350 off sale on each and bought it on last day of sale.  The next day Lowe's had it back on sale with the same discounts. Before I ever used it Samsung put out a safety recall on it to correct the problem of the top flying off under certain conditions.  I had Samsung do their safety repair before I ever used it.  To do it the top is removed and some brackets added and other switched around and then the top put back.  I then started to use it but several weeks later I went to use the built in sink and found the latch wasn't working properly and the sink stayed attached to the top.  I've reported the problem to Samsung and I'm waiting for a repair.  Looking closely I now see a dent on one side of the top and I know to do the safety repair they had to pull and push hard on the top to get it off and then back on.  I expect that's also why the built in sink isn't staying down now.
5.0,"""Love love love this washer""",It is everything I hoped. It cleans cloths so nicely. They come out almost dry! Many options! And easy to operate. I love the sink I use it all the time with a 3 yet old who spills things. I would recommend this to anybody!
2.0,"""short on dependability""","We have had the washer for 13 months. Everything was good until the machine stopped with 9 minutes left. Samsung was quick to play the 12 month warranty card. Fortunately we had added the Lowes extension plan and they are being wonderful in trying to solve the problem(s). They have already been here 3 times and spent more money than the unit cost and are still coming one more time with even more parts. We will be without a machine for about a month which means 8 trips to the laundermat which is 18 miles away. If you buy it, add the extended warranty."
1.0,"""Washer is defective & customer service is HORRIBLE""","After two years of owning the washer I need it serviced because it is making a radling noise but there is no one in my area to repair the washer.  Dealing wish customer service is truly horrible.  They give me a different answer every time I call.  They leave voicemails on my answering machine and don't leave numbers they just say ""look forward to speaking to you in the future"" then never call back!! They closed my ticket for no reason about the washer so now I have to start all over again.  I'm supposed to get a refund for my defective washer and I am being ignored!! Also the pulsator cap keeps breaking in the washer so I have to keep ordering new ones and I can't use the washer for almost a week.  The dryer stopped working because the plastic tension wheel broke.  After us repairing that ourselves the dryer now makes a noise.  Worst 1500.00 I have ever spent!!!"
