5.0,"""Brand New""",Just received these a week ago and trying them out. They seem to be working fantastic and are very quiet.
5.0,"""Worth the money""","The washer is a bit pricey comparing against other conventional washers. But this washer comes with a delicate washer on top, which is ideal for us because we can reserve it for our baby and kid. The main washer performance is in par with other Samsung up-scale washers."
5.0,"""Works nicely""","First of all, this thing is a beast. It weighs 300 pounds and was no picnic to get up to the third floor of our townhouse. That being said, it works very well. It is very quiet and vibration-free, and much faster than our last (10 year old) Samsung washer. The mini washer on top works great and is a real convenience. Interestingly, there is no prewash option, but this hasn't been a problem. Also, I have not yet tried out the smartphone control."
4.0,"""Recommendations for samsung""","Love the machines, but the factory hose is so big it sticks out of the wall too much. Looking for a smaller hose to connect to my dryer"
