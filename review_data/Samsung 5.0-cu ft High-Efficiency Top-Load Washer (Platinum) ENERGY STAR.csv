4.0,"""Virgo2017""","Great washer!  Gets the job done!  A little deep because I am not tall but can handle it,"
5.0,"""Great Washer""",I just ordered the matching dryer.  I got my washer recently after reacting to the recall.  It washes just as good as the original. I am very happy with the washer and I am looking forward to getting the dryer.
5.0,"""Great washer""","I received my washer and dryer today. I have done 4 loads already and have no issues with anything. I love the no agitatir because it makes doing blankets and sheets a dream!  And it has a brilliant whites setting and maybe it is wishful thinking, but I swear the whites really are brighter!Pull the trigger and buy the set. You won't be disappointed."
1.0,"""No Wash Machine""","This machine does not wash clothes, period. First one made loud noise from day one. Left soap residue on clothes. Tried three different detergents, same result. Doesn't wash out deodorant, or the odor it's supposed to stop. Second machine same lack of washing ability, same noise started after two weeks. Maybe Samsung detuned these machines after the exploding machines recall?? Returned to store for different brand."
4.0,"""Love it!! But not for short people!""","I'M 5""3 and I had to buy a step stool just to reach the clothes on the bottom of the washer.  Its comical to watch my daughter 5""2 jump and grab the clothes.  For this reason I gave a 4."
3.0,"""Had to exchange unit.""",It made a lot of noise.  Sounded like the motor was grinding.  It is being replaced tomorrow.  I hope the replacement is better.
1.0,"""Disappointing""",I have had this machine for 3 years and it has been serviced twice. Even the technician admitted that this model has had recalls and issues.
1.0,"""The worse home purchase I ever made""","If I could give zero stars I would. The washer does not wash. Have owned for less then a week,I have done 6 loads. I followed all written directions, did as instructed to "" mix loads"" just did a load with one set queen size sheets, mixed with kitchen towels and hand-towels and a few socks. One towel came out complete dry, no not from spinning, it was DRY, it never got wet. Another came out with the same spots it went in with, and no it was not set in food stains.  The definition of to wash , is to clean with soap and water, this washer does not wash.DO NOT BUY this washer!"
3.0,"""Too deep-needs to come with grabber""",Who knew? I never thought about this when choosing this new top load washer. I have a difficult time reaching the bottom of the tub. Should have purchased the 4.5-but no - husband had to get the BIGGER one.  I'm going to have to buy a long handeled grabber. Other than that the machine works well.
1.0,"""Not a good buy""","I put my king size sheets in to wash and came back after a few minutes to find almost no water in the drum.  I measured about a half inch of water in the drum for a whole set of king size sheets.  It took me 7 buckets of water from the bathroom to get enough water in there to come just short of the top of the load.  That is not water saving, that is pointless."
1.0,"""Not happy""",Well bought it from Lowes which sales lady never told us it doesn't come with hoses so when Lowes delivered it they would not install the washer.   Bought hoses on way home and installed washer would not go into calibrate mode per instructions in manual even called customer service who walked me thru steps and it still would not go into calibrate mode.   Found a you tube video of process and it finally started calibrate mode but doesn't finish.  Lowes can fix the issue being it's less than 2 hours of use or I'll buy another brand
5.0,"""Great washer""","I purchased this under the recall program for a previous 4.5 CU FT Samsung which I loved and worked perfectly. This 5 CU FT Samsung works great. No problems whatsoever. Delivered and installed by Lowes. It's relatively quiet although I have a door to my laundry room so not really an issue. The tub is deep so if you're short it'll be a reach to grab the socks off the bottom. I would recommend the 4.5 CU FT model in this case which could handle a king comforter without problems. I love all the features. No issues washing big loads of towels, sheets, bedding, etc. Everything seems to come out clean and fresh. I turned off all the sounds. The controls are very intuitive and easy to setup a load for washing. I would recommend this washer to friends."
1.0,"""worst machine I ever bought""",delivered 5/10 worked till 7/27 when it broke. Samsung repair came 3 times each time with new parts. Last time they were going to replace all the wiring. I told them take it back. I went out and bought a ge.

5.0,"""Really nice, quiet washer""",I really like this washer. It has so many options for washing. When the cycle is completely finished it chimes a series of pretty chimes. I am glad I bought it and hope it lasts forever.
