5.0,"""Great appliance.""",Controls are very intuitive. Larger than our old one. Make sure it will fit your space. Very quite.
2.0,"""Love the size, but issues after less than a year""","I like this machine for it's size and features. It has done a decent job at washing clothes. It does get unbalanced time to time, but nothing too horrible. My biggest issue is that after 6 months the cheap ""stainless/platinum"" in the inside lip has peeled off and is now rusting. Not what I would expect for a new washer. Called Samsung and it's not covered under Warranty, so beware."
1.0,"""Washer exploded""","We purchased the washer and dryer from the store on 10/25/15. Had been using it a few times a week since it was delivered. Today we were washing a fitted sheet and mattress cover when the drum exploded. It shook the entire house and water and pieces of the drum flew everywhere. The entire front of the machine buckled out, its knocked a hole in the bottom of the dryer and the wall from the force. The entire top of the washer blew off. Called the store and we were told to call the service number. Called them and they can't send anyone out until Wednesday. Going to the store to see what they can do from there.After doing some research online I've seen 2 other videos from people that this happened to as well. Not sure what we will do next."
5.0,"""Best investment""","I have used and owned a lot of different washers. My family goes through clothes so fast and it is almost impossible to keep up with the demand of laundry! I knew and was told to make sure this would fit through my basement doors because it is 31 inches. I would have knocked down a wall to have this washer, but it fit like a glove! The features are amazing. With two dogs and two cats my bedding, curtains, and rugs need cleaned often. The allergy feature might take longer time, but its worth every minute. I can fit two queen size comforters with ease and still have room for towels! My clothes come out clean and soft. My rugs look brand new even with the Pittsburgh muddy weather. I could go on and on. Do not read the negative reviews & stop looking at what to buy. This is by far the best darn washer to get. It does go on sale for 799."
1.0,"""BUYER BEWARE!! Don't do it!!""","I bought this machine for the additional features for wash options and timing as well as the larger load capacity.Well let me just share that my house has been under construction since January and I've been living in my guest house. I was also pregnant throughout the course of this project. So going without laundry on a consistent basis has been a challenge. Starting in January I started to get the UA code which is uneven. No matter what I do to load this thing I get this code, in which you have to start the entire load over again!! Yes, I am currently still working on finishing one load from YESTERDAY MORNING!!! Apparently my kids won't have any clean bedsheets by the time school starts on Monday. As I try to move back into my home this issue CONTINUES. I have had service out here SEVERAL TIMES, they have replaced computer and NOTHING. This is the WORSE piece of JUNK Samsung is trying to pass off on their clients. I am SO ANGRY I am going to stop buying their TV's and more. I WANT A REFUND!!!!! Because all I ask as a consumer is for a working product!!"
5.0,"""Loving My New Sammy !!!!!!!!!""","Laundry used to be an all day chore since I had to make short loads on my old rusty washer that was on it's last spin. I wanted to get something I would love and would suit our needs now and for a few yrs to come. When Samsung announced the debut of this washer I started researching and following various tests and reviews, still since ""Old Betsy"" was still getting the job done I didn't want to just get a new washer.When hubby bought a Split-King adjustable bed I knew it was time for ""Betsy"" to retire.I realize there aren't any perfect machines and there will always be some bad reviews out there no matter what, they are man made machines, but as a whole this machine is well liked.I've used it very much over 3 mths now and have yet to have a problem. As of right now I can say this is the best washer I have ever owned,it's oh so quiet, has an option for our every need, and we are super impressed with the extra cleanliness of our laundry. It has to be saving us money as I was having to wash and rinse clothes 2X's in prior machine just to make them appear what I thought was clean,but once I saw my whites after 1 wash with this baby,I realized how fooled I had been thinking I was getting clean clothes before...I was finally able to wash comforters @ home and that went over without a hitch. The laundry is barely damp when I remove them which is also easier since I don't have to stand on my head anymore and I'm only 5'6""..so drying times have definitely reduced.All that time I thought I was washing my clothes they were still dirty..ewww..plus used to believe there was no way to get clothes clean without an agitator ...Wrong.....I purchased the Platinum color set online during a sale. The chat rep. was able to tell me which stores had it readily in stock to purchase and which zip code to put for that store,since hometown stores were sold out.Delivery went well,guys were on time, friendly, and knew the product wellI am happy with new ""Sammy"" now I actually look forward to doing laundry.....LOL !!!!!!!!!!"
5.0,"""Best washer I have ver had and I love it!""",The washer is the perfect size and does a great job! Sorry no cons on this product!!
5.0,"""Huge""",Love it. Normal drain pans do not fit. Had to join 2 together.
5.0,"""GREAT Set!!""",I have now had this set for over a year! I am still in love with it to this day! I love all the extra features they each have on them! They are easy to figure out how to run as well! I am still just now using some of the features it offers because I just dont have a need for some of them all the time. I would say the only complaint I have is that the dryer doesn't stay 100% quiet like it starts out but its not loud by any means! I also LOVE how much you can load them down with and they still get clean and dry perfectly!
5.0,"""Samsung stainless steel washer HE""",We got this after our old washer was not doing its job any more. I tried out the hardest wash first on my work clothes and it was better than the older model we replaced with the Samsung HE washer. They were very clean and I was very much pleased with this model. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in a really good washer.
1.0,"""Stay Away""","Big mistake buying something I thought would be able to effectively and efficiently keep up with the washing demands in my large home. Please note that if you pay for a water bill in your town it will double once you buy this washer. Found that out the hard way and validated on the internet - seems not many people noted that in these reviews.Second, it often goes off balance and is a pain to reorganize wet clothes. To move clothes around and go to spin cycle requires me to unplug washer as the knob becomes frozen."
5.0,"""Huge washer""",I have still not had enough laudry to fill up this washer. It is huge and I love all of the specialized wash settings.
4.0,"""Great size but....""","I love the size of the drum in this model. I can wash all of our towels, including beach towels, on one load and it doesn't get off balance. Jeans, the same thing. The cycles, while varied, are still limited and the machine is louder than my Samsung front loaders were. The signal that sounds at the end of the cycle is also long and loud. Cleans and spins well."
1.0,"""Hate it""",Hate washer very much. Does not wash clothes very well. Constantly have to realign clothing and wash clothes over and over. Went for my front load washer of 13 years back to a top load that holds more clothing. I want my old washer back would love to swap it back out with a new front loader.
1.0,"""Clothes Were Still Dirty""","My husband and I were immediately attracted to this washer because of the size and steam feature. My husband is a water well driller and comes home full of mud and muck. To my dissapointment this washer did not clean his clothes. It didn't matter what cycle I used, how many pre soaks I did, or how many rinses I did, his clothes still came out filthy. I've never had this problem before with our old LG washer which did me good for a little over a decade. I think I'm going to call a repair man to see if he could repair the old washer and return this one asap! Also, the exterior of this product appears to me to be cheaply made. It scrathes way to easily! My old washer is also stainless still and I never had to worry about scratches."
1.0,"""Danger!!""","My husband and I bought this washer and the matching dryer only 5 months ago. At first we just loved the huge drum and how much wash can be done at one time. HOWEVER, there has been a major issue that has come up. While doing a load of wash we heard a HUGE crash in the basement where the washer was located. During the rinse cycle the washer came unbalanced. Due to the force of the drum inside the washer actually pulled itself from the plumbing and the control panel and lid flew off the washer!!! Our water heater was next to the dryer. The force of the washer caused damage to the water heater also. I have never seen or heard of this happening ever before. Our dryer is actually in pieces!!!!! I have a 5 year old daughter that helps me with the wash. She could of been very hurt if she was near by. Please take a second thought before buying this product. I would not want anyone to get hurt."
4.0,"""Washes a lot of clothes!""","SO much so, that when I wash a fluid it doesn't fit in my dryer! I still have my old dryer. It would probably fit in the dryer that goes with this washer."
1.0,"""BEST WASTE OF MONEY EVER LMAO !!!!!!!!""",My old washer broke down at night time. Had just an hour and a half to get another before the store closed. Yes it has all the bells and whistles. Yes it is freakin HUGE inside. And it is wider by fare than my old one so I had to make more room for it. Yes if this one breaks down I'll probably have NO WAY of getting it fixed for the company only wants your money and that's SAMSUNG.
1.0,"""wrong size!""","I just had these delivered today - and they don't fit through my laundry room door! The website stated that the washer was 25 inches wide - it is 31 inches wide! I called Lowes so they can correct the website, but now my husband is removing the door and the door jamb and hoping it all fits, otherwise they have to be returned. You would think the sight would emphasize that they are bigger than the average machine!"
4.0,"""Nice!""",Just got this delivered yesterday. Performs very quietly and enjoy the many features so far!
5.0,"""Best Washer""","This is the best washer we ever have used. Front loaders stink! We had a Samsung front loader it didn't wash very well, mildew was also a major problem. When we bought the top loader all issues went away.Great features from cycle selection to ease of use."
5.0,"""First Samsung Appliance""","First time I purchased a Samsung appliance. I am impressed with overall customer care and support. Warning - Washer is big, so make sure you take measurements before purchase."
1.0,"""Worst washer I've ever owned""","I've made a mistake by switching to the this top loader washer. I ended up not saving $$ on my water bill since I have to wash every load twice to get my clothes clean. Always have to use extra rinse option and yet, one cycle is not enough. Clothes comes out still dirty and more wrinkles than washing with a top load. I never pack my clothes, barely fill the tub with less than half of its capacity. I do not recommend this washer, save your $$. A much less expensive washer can wash clothes much better than this one."
4.0,"""Nice!""",Just got this delivered yesterday. Performs very quietly and enjoy the many features so far!
5.0,"""I am LOVING my new Washing machine!!""","My husband and I just purchased our brand new Samsung washing machine. I was looking for a large capacity washer that is a top loader and found this one. The capacity inside of the tub is HUGE!!!. I already washed 3 loads and honestly, my towels have never come out as clean and dry ever in my previous washing machine.  I highly, highly recommend this washer!!"
1.0,"""Don't waste your money""","Noticed when placing clothes in drum, the clothes on top stayed on top throughout entire wash cycle. They weren't agitated AT ALL! Called tech support & was told that if clothes were completely wet then they were clean. I don't agree. I've resorted to pausing wash cycle halfway through & moving clothes around in water manually.  Also noticed that bleach was being dispensed about 1 minute before completion of wash cycle & water was drained. Service call resulted in technician being told by Samsung support, ""if bleach is dispensed any time during wash cycle there is not a problem"". I manually have to add bleach to wash cycle.  ALSO, the ""stainless steel"" laminate on the inside lid above the drum is peeling. Very surprised that this is not covered under warranty because it is a cosmetic fault. Must've been caused by improper use application of detergent & bleach??????"
5.0,"""Awesome product!!!""","I love this washer! I haven't had one single problem washing a fluffy king sized comforter!! I have let the laundry go for a couple of weeks and am able to catch it up often in 1 load, very rare that it take 2."
5.0,"""This is the quickest, quiestest, most beautiful washer I have ever owned.""",I can't believe it is on when it is doing the wash. It is that quiet. Don't let all the choices intimidate you-it is very intuitive. You will save money using this machine and your clothes are going to last longer. I just love this washer and dryer. I never thought I would say that about a washer and dryer in my life.
5.0,"""Large feature packed washer""",I have been using this washer for a month. It is huge. It handled a load of linens no problem with room to spare. It is easy to use the controls and gives you plenty of options for the wash settings. The lid does not feel very sturdy but that was consistent with many of the top load washers these days. The only issue I have had so far is that it showed an error after the second wash. It was supposed to be for an issue in the water connections. I checked each connection but did not see anything. I reset the machine and have not seen the error again.
5.0,"""great performance!""","I was l a little skeptical at first, so i waited for a couple of months of usage to make my comments and my conclusion is that the machine performed excellent both washer and dryer, i guess i was so used to the ""old fashion way"" The new technology has been performing great and hopefully for the years to come . i have to say that the positive comments reading the reviews have been accurate, and I'm glad that we made this choice.Rene & Karen"
5.0,"""Best Washer Ever Owned""",This is by far the best washer I have ever owned it is quite and efficient. I can select from a variety of settings based on my needs. My clothes don't only feel cleaner they are fresher and softer. If you are in the market for a new washer you won't regret going with a Samsung.
1.0,"""Issues with constant lid break""","I bought this washing machine two years ago and purchased an extended insurance after one year. It's because the lid was constantly breaking during the first year and one time, it stopped working. I couldn't trust this washer to last another 3 years. In addition, this washer is such a nuisance when it operates, it's noisy and has strong vibrations. Another obstacle is when I make insurance claim because that's another dilemma. Now I'm looking for options to buy another washer even though the extended insurance did not expire yet, but I can't waste anymore of my time and energy on a dysfunctional washer like this."

1.0,"""This by far one of the best top loader washing machines produced by your company.""",Only that it has been recalled for a defect. It can be repaired and returned for service though.Thank you for being honest.
5.0,"""Great design""","Great product, can handle really big loads with ease. Fits king size comforter easily and handles really well. Expensive but you get a high quality product."
4.0,"""Finally a New Washer""","I love this washer. It is silent, easy to use and holds our King quilts!! Used to have to go the laundry mat to do that. I am also a short lady and I can reach the bottom of the basin without a stool. No more almost faling in."
5.0,"""Great features""","Love using my washer, however, have to be mindful of not overloading or not balancing load properly because of computerized features. I was looking for a washer that would adequately handle king size comforters so that I did not have to take mine to the cleaners (too expensive) and this does the job."
5.0,"""This Machine handles huge loads easily""","I purchased this top loading washing machine and the matching gas dryer as a surprise present for my wife while she was away. She has always hated the front loading machine that came with our home, mold problems along the front seal. I am flat amazed at their performance! I work heavy construction, and come home most days covered in grime, and have to be constantly doing wash to keep work clothes ready for heavy use. The first time I used this washing machine and dryer, I was able to load them with a weeks worth of clothes in one load, with plenty of room to spare.This would normally have been three loads on the old machines. What a time saver!! The clothes came out much cleaner and fresher than we were used to from the other machines. I did a lot of searches online before picking this model, and really like the EZ-Reach design for a huge capacity top loading machine. The wife is gonna love this when she gets home."
5.0,"""Great design""","Great product, can handle really big loads with ease. Fits king size comforter easily and handles really well. Expensive but you get a high quality product."
5.0,"""Great size, perfect for everyone!""","I am very satisfied with this washer that we recently purchased. Our old washer was just not big enough. We would have to spend extra money to go to the laundromat to wash our comforters and spent lots of money. This washer is not only great because of the multiple features it has... aqua jets, sanitize, drum light, etc,. but you save time on doing laundry by minimizing how many loads you need to wash. Great buy, totally worth it!!!"
5.0,"""Impressive""","I purchased my washer in February but waited to write my review. I search and reviewed a lot of washers before settling on Samsung model. This is my first Samsung washer. One of the features that I like is that it can handle comforters. I wanted to really used my washer and become familiar with all of the features and wash cycles. I read other reviews and I am very happy with my purchase. It is very quiet no vibration. I sometimes have to check to see if it working. The complete sound is not very loud. The control panel is easy to see and use. Has a very large tub but I can reach the bottom very easily for a 5'2"" person. The only complaint I have is I can't see the wash due to the very dark glass top."
1.0,"""disappointed""","This washer worked great for 6 month. It reduced our weekly loads by 50%. It suddenly started to have a spin cycle failure with all our loads. The problem has escalated to no longer having a successful spin cycle. For a ""top of the line"" washer this is not acceptable....."
3.0,"""Takes to long""",This washer takes to long to wash a load and doesn't get the clothes the cleanest.
5.0,"""Love the size""","I have had this washer for about two weeks now. I really wanted one that would accommodate my king size bedding. This one fits the bill. I also like the fact that I do less laundry than before. It holds more per wash. Our clothes come out feeling cleaner and fresher. I did have to use the self clean cycle already. It said in the manual after about 20 loads of laundry.All is good. So far, no issues.I chose this particular model after choosing two others, than cancelling those. Glad I chose this one."
1.0,"""This prodcut has major design flaws""",Brand new machine has had internal hose fall of twice in the first two months. Flooded laundry room and beyond. water just poured out of machine. The clamp that holds the internal hose on is too weak to do the job. DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!!!!
5.0,"""Best Washer, bright display, durable.""",Large family. economical because can wash larger loads of clothes and save water since it is high efficiency. Well worth the purchase.
2.0,"""Rust and Balance issues""","This washer gets out of balance easily and you have to reach in and readjust the load too often. Also, I have had problems with rust. The""stainless steel"" inside rim is a plastic film which has peeled away from the inside edge and is all rusty."
1.0,"""Defective Top""",In 1.5 years the plastic skin on the top of the washer has delaminated (bubbled up and off) and had to be replaced. It required some effort to get it replaced this second time despite the same recurrent problem when under warranty. Samsung will not admit that this a defect in the bonding of the skin to the cover and their responsibility.
5.0,"""Samsung Washer""","I'm absolutely in love with how easy this product is! I had a hand-me-down and really thought it would be more difficult being brand new and so hi-tech looking, but it's really easy. Oh and the size, I can fit almost anything in this thing!"
5.0,"""this product has great capabilities""","this product satisfies my household needs. it gives us serval options in size of loads and even quick wash. trouble shooting instrutions are clear, love capability of large loads is a plus. love the plantium color and digital bright display"
5.0,"""Awesome product""",I have been using washing machines for 45 years. This is the best machine. I am very happy with my choice. The clothes come out fresh and clean. I had a set of sheets washed with the old dryer and was ready to throw them out (as I have with many items) because they had a musty smell. I decided to give my new washer a try. The smell came right out and saved me money. The drum is huge so no worries (actually bigger than I need) about items floating over and getting into the drain and or pump. The ease of the controls is awesome. Many choices and I can save my own special settings to use. The machine is inside the house and so quiet! It has a steam and antibacterial setting. I had my last washer ten years. I could have set up my own repair company for as much as it cost me to constantly repair the machine! I really did my homework on researching washing machines before my purchase. My daughter bought one first and was extremely happy with it as well. There is not one thing I can complain about or am dissatisfied with.
5.0,"""Quite""",Running very quite and have had no trouble with it.
5.0,"""TOP-LOAD WASHER""",I really like the washer. Plenty of room for large loads.
5.0,"""Big tub""",Love my Samsung Top Load Washer with EZ Reach it has the big tub and my wife also love it cause she short and can reach to the bottom of the tub with using a step stool.
3.0,"""This washer is too problematic""",After 6 weeks of use i had to have it REPLACED... It washes ok BUT with the bedding there's always problems so i have to take it out dripping & put it to dry outside WITHOUT it being spun & drained...I have 5 kids so I need a reliable washer & dryer... I'm going to keep it because it was so expensive i can't just go get another... HOWEVER i saw the commercial for the new one where you can ADD ON clothes with no problem.... like i said i have 5 kids so that feature is something i need!!!
5.0,"""Samsung Products""",We thank you Samsung for the tremendous work . A+A
