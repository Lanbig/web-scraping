5.0,"""Overall a good washing machine""","I have owned & used this machine over a year now. I don't trust reviews written by those who have owned a product for only a short time, especially one that takes time to learn and for faults to show, like a washing machine! Please, don't write a reviews until you have really had a chance to use a product and wait until the ""glow"" (or a bad initial experience) wears off.  With that said, overall this has been a very good washing machine. There are tons of features and I have used most. This should please almost anyone. Modest price, but features that are on more expensive units. The capacity is great. The controls are easy to figure out. We have allergy issues so the ""allergen"" cycle is great for that A few reviewers have complained about a ""smell""...I always leave the door open at least an hour or two after a wash load is emptied. When I do that, I have no issue. There is a drum cleaning cycle and used it once. But I have found there is little odor if I air it out. The drum itself is still spotless today! For the most part, I use detergent paks, and have no issues with clothes not coming out fresh and clean. I have found the liquid fabric softener dish seems to clog, but I rarely use that, and the detergent dish has no clogging problem when I have used it.. The machine is quiet and I have seen NO EVIDENCE that the labels wear out or come off!  The built quality seems good, and have had no external wear at all..still looks new. And I downloaded the ""app"" which diagnoses problem codes: never used it, so deleted it! I have NEVER had a load stop, become un-balanced or not finish for any reason! That was one of the biggest complaints I read about regarding HE Washers in general, but I have had absolutely NO ISSUES like that, with this machine. The only ""con"" I can think of, is the height of the machine. As a 6'3"" person, it can be a challenge to get the laundry out of this front loading machine. I did not purchase a stand, and if I had, that would have taken care of that!"
5.0,"""Great Appliance!""","Beautiful color. Runs so so quiet. Nice ring tones as alerts on machine. Has Steam feature that connects with dryer. The price is very competitive now as apposed to years ago for this machine. Comes with a 10 year manufacture warranty on the drive belt which says to me that the manufacturer has confidence in their appliance. Also purchased the matching dryer and is super quiet as well. Both drums hold a ton of clothing, towels, etc."
2.0,"""lasted 3 years""","Overall this is a nice washer machine with great features and smooth running. Unfortunately it is also poorly built. On the third year the spinning cycle started getting louder and louder and the whole thing would shake violently. Had a Sear tech coming to check it and dropped the bomb. The main chamber bearing is worn off and needs to be changed. I am talking about standard use, a 3 adult household using the machine 2 times a week in average.Just getting a new bearing will cost $750, bought directly form Samsung, labor will bring the total to $930. So, now we are just waiting for the washer to die and preparing to get a new one. My first and last Samsung appliance, in fact my last Samsung anything."
5.0,"""The BEST washer and dryer ever built""","I purchased a new style LG because it liiked really impressive, after two replacements, we went back to what we knew. This is their new style Samsung and it is the best washer and dryer that I have ever had. My wife loves this washer, and it is fast and efficient. It outperforms the other Samsung unit that we had, which suprised me, because it worked really well. I assure you you will be ultimately impressed with this unit along with its steam dryer partner."
5.0,"""I love em'""","I love this washer. The only thing I don't like is the smell, but it is fading. I love the chirping noise it makes. I love all the various settings. This washer has a huge capacity. I would buy this one again!! It washes very well and clothes come out smelling great. I would not pay full price for it, but I got it on a great sale and it was well worth it."
4.0,"""Nice Machine for the Price""","This review is for the WF42H5200AF 4.2-cu ft High-Efficiency Front-Load Washer with Steam Cycle (Merlot). To begin with, I want to explain to potential buyers of this machine about the negative reviews. When I first set up the washer, I thought I had everything leveled just right. The problem was, I set the level in the center on top of the machine from front to back and in the center from left to right. (It showed a true level) I did the test cycle and I thought the machine was going to go flying apart. I then leveled the machine by putting the level on all four sides, on top of course which was rear, left to right, front, left to right, and both sides front to back. After everything was leveled in this manner, I washed my first load, only taking up half of the washing machines capacity.Sure, there is only a few thumps now for the first few seconds of a rinse or spin cycle. This is normal. I have 3 friends who own frontloads. A Samsung like mine (Which why I bought mine, and I did not ask my friend about how he set his up, whish I did), a Whirlpool and an LG. They all make this little thump when going to spin or rinse.As far as the detergent tray, people are saying that they are experiencing excessive water trapped in there. Well, after my wash is done, I barely have a tablespoon of water thats left behind, regardless if i use Tide Pods directly in the machine or Tide Liquid in the tray. I am thinking those who are complaining about that, their machines are leaning down hill so to speak.Another issue I see is people wondering/complaining why they do not see much water in the machine while washing. For one, the water is in between the stainless tub and a plastic outer tub. If you look closely at the agitators, there are small holes that releases the water while in the wash/rinse mode.Now for the quality. The quality is great, except for the control panel. It is plastic of course. The red color does not match the rest of the machine, but it is close. This control panel scratches fairly easy. I have had no issues of broken or flimsy doors (Or leaks yet, I hope not) but I did buy the 5 year extended warranty.Finally, what I do like about this washer. It is quiet while washing. I can smell the cleanliness when the clothes are done. The clothes spin dry very well. This machine has cut my dryer time in half. I love the touch button controls.As with all frontload machines, remember to keep the door ajar after your final wash. This will keep your machine from forming mildew."
5.0,"""So far best washer we've had.""","This washer beats our old Whirlpool Duet by a long shot. Purchased Duet in 2006:new bearings in 2010, 2012, 2014, new MCU ($308), clothes & washer stank after use.The price was a deal, clothes are fresher smelling, spins well enough that dryer is not taking as long, & the features ease of use is great.I would recommend this washer to anyone."
5.0,"""Moved and needed to buy new washer and dryer""","I had a Samsung that was about five years old that I liked so I stayed with the brand. Does a great job with the laundry with minimal wear and tear on the items washed. Spins out very, very dry. There are a great many choices about cycle and treatment. I like that it has a spin only setting which my previous washer did not have.Not fond of the faux chrome look. Would prefer something more utilitarian looking in my laundry room but understand this is not the trend."
5.0,"""Great Machine""","No problems so far. It is real easy if you read the owners manual first. Hoses DO come with the machine. Sales man tried to sell me a set but the old ones were still good. I was just going to replace the washers but there was a new set of hoses in the washer. I got a Military discount on top of the sale price = Great Deal. Set up was a breeze did it all myself. No problem balancing. Settings are many. We ended up with the Heavy Duty, Eco warm, fast spin and heavy soil. Programed it in to memory, ""My Setting"". Clean fresh smelling almost dry clothes every time."
5.0,"""Love this machine""","I had this washing machine for a month and so far I haven't had any problems with it.Delivery was on time and after reading the manual it was ready to do laundry.I didn't get the pedestals and actually I think its best if the machine sits on the floor. It washes quietly and you don't even hear it running until it is spinning the clothes out. I don't know why some people complain that it is loud when spinning. Yes it does make noise when on the spin cycle but that is normal. Sometimes the machine does get off balance but the machine stops itself and automatically balances itself. This is normal for a front load machine because the clothes are tumbling unlike a front load washer where you place the clothes evenly and they stay that way.I tried every cycle on this washer and I think my favorite is bedding because it uses the most water. It does clean clothes real good even on normal which uses the least amount of water. The first load I did I had a shirt in the washer with oil stains from frying food and the washer took the stain out and I was impressed.Some people complain that there is water in the soap container, mine doesn't have water in the soap container. Maybe they didn't level the machine good? Also with the soap container the plastic inserts act as siphon cap, so if you don't leave the blue liquid fabric softer plastic piece in, the water will not drain.This is a good washing machine and I haven't had a single problem with it. Just remember to REMOVE THE SHIPPING BOLTS, Level the machine and RUN THE CALIBRATION MODE by pressing Temp and Delayed end at the same time then press the start button. Calibration mode is important because once the machine is leveled and isn't wobbling on any of the 4 corners, the calibration modes adapts the machines drum spinning and provides a more accurate weight level for water to be added to the machine.Now to save for the matching dryer. I am in love with laundry now, the machine performs beautifully and she is a beauty to look at too. Laundry is no longer a chore with this machine, it is a pleasure.also the seal drains real good, I do wipe it down to prevent mold and I also leave the door open a little bit so the machine can air out for a couple of hours after I used it."
2.0,"""Good Washer - But has quit working after 7 months""","Prior to last week I would have given this product 5 stars, but it just quit working. No 7 month old appliance should quit in this time-frame. Fortunately, it is still under manufacturer and extended warranty."
5.0,"""ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!""",Gets the clothes super clean. Its so quiet most the time I don't even know its running. I finally have a washer big enough to wash my extra thick king comforter. no complaints
2.0,"""Letters on control panel wipe off""","The washer works pretty well for washing clothes and I have no complaints besides the control panel. The lettering for all the controls and settings on the control panel are not affixed, or printed on the panel well. My experience was one day I walked up to the washer and a couple of settings were smeared real bad. I tried wiping them lightly with a soft dry cloth and they just wiped off. I then dabbed them with water and it removed the smeared part but other parts were still there. Then a couple of months later same thing. Samsung will not fix it, they claim it is cosmetic and it is not covered. When the lettering wipes off the control panel and you cannot read the settings I think it is more than cosmetic. I have seen where this is not an isolated issue with Samsung Washers, by researching the internet. By the way we only use HE detergent and do not use fabric softeners or any other products. If laundry detergent causes the lettering to come off then it is not a very good washer. Customer Service through Samsung was terrible."
5.0,"""Love it!""","I have saved 50% in water usage! as well as Landry detergent and softener. Our electric bill has also gone down, one of the best purchases we have ever made. Oh! By the way our clothes are cleaner now!"
5.0,"""Love it so far""","I've never used anything but a bog-standard washer before, so the array of settings and the way you can combine them selectively is great. I haven't tried out all of them yet, but I especially like the ""no spin"" option for semi-delicate stuff you just want to wash, drain and hang out on the line. Cleans well; quickly when you need it for light-to-regular loads; deeply when you're washing grubby work clothes or something the cat has barfed on. Mainly though, the ""Merlot"" set we bought is a really pretty shade of red - if you're going by the online photos alone, this Samsung set is a bit darker than the comparable LG set Lowe's offers, which is more of a bright fire engine red. Red appliances won't work in every setting, but this one does for us, and there's no need to hide it in a cupboard, which was brilliant as we didn't have the space to do that in our tiny laundry room. Have had lots of compliments on the color.Word to the wise - read the instructions before cleaning the filter (yes, there is a filter on it, recommended for cleaning every two months). Some water will drain out when you do this, so make sure you have something in which to catch it. Also, like most front-loaders it benefits from an airing-out after a wash to avoid mustiness; I speed this up by wiping down the door and drum with a clean cloth first."
1.0,"""Didn't last""",We bought this washing machine 4 years ago and after that time the bearings and drums need replacing due to balance issues. We won't be buying another Samsung as the technician said this is a common problem with this brand.
5.0,"""great purchase""","my wife loved it when i bought her maytag topload HE set and it was very bad left the clothes shribbled n just like twisted, so i returned them for samsung front load HE and the difference is incredible best set ever clothes come out rinkle free ..."
4.0,"""Satisfied so far""","They had all items purchased in stock, so delivery was fast. This is my first front loader, but I have LG/Samsung flat screens and really like the quality of the brand. Washer is a little noisy at times until the load balances out. The dryer is great and both units have a lot of feature and is easy to use. The washer has a filter that will need to be replaced periodically (I didn't know that at time of purchase. But after a week of use I'm very happy and they fit perfectly in the laundry room.The guys that delivered and set it up were very nice and professional."
5.0,"""Such a good purchase!""","I had a Whirlpool Duet for 10 years & when it was dying I did a lot of research on high efficency washers. I seriously debated between the Sumsung and a LG both with the steam cycle.The capacity of this washer is greater than my old machine and much quieter. The other aspect that I really appreciate is that the machine seems to do better with larger loads and is does not do the loud sounds that my Whirlpool used to make. The 10 year warranty was a nice surprise, although the reviews on the warranty are rather sketchy.The added bonus for me was the color of the machine and the sale price was what finally sold me on the Samsung. I'm so pleased with this purchase!!My only negative comment was getting the machine from Lowes to my home, as delivery to my area was not an option. (Common Lowes, you delivered to me in the past.) As a single person who does not have a vehicle large enough to transport this was disappointing. I offered to pay more for delivery and ended up renting a truck to get it home."
1.0,"""Samsung Front Load Washer VERY disapointing""","I purchased this washing machine brand because the manager of the Canandaigua, NY Lowe's Appliance department touted its outstanding qualities in comparison to other front loaders. Unfortunately, after using it for one day, I completely disagreed with the Lowe's manager. A new one was delivered a week later (annoying), but there was no difference, with the exception of the dents that came with the first washer.  The first issue (remains) the 'racking' of the washer when I put it on high spin, which I never do anymore because my whole house vibrates! The high spin is supposed to be a quality of this machine, as it reduces drying time. I went on-line to query what other Samsung washing machine owners have experienced and found that I was not alone with this problem. One Samsung washing machine owner used boat bumpers to stabilize the machine when it was spinning and walking all over the floor. I have done that (on both sides!) and it does help.  When they saw the bumpers, the Lowe's manager and delivery persons agreed that I should not have to do this...duh! By the way, the machine is perfectly balanced (I made sure of that by breaking out my level while the delivery person was at my home). Additionally, the Samsung front loading machine is NOT ergonomically designed, as it is very difficult to remove clothes from the washing barrel.  Finally, the bleach dispenser does not work properly, as it dispenses the bleach undiluted into the washing barrel (completely ruining several items).I caution anyone thinking of purchasing a Samsung front load washing machine 4.2 cu ft high efficiency stack able front-loader washer with steam cycle."
5.0,"""Great Wash Machine""","We have had our machine for only a week but I can already tell that it is a cut above the Kenmore appliances we replaced after only 5 1/2 years. Runs quietly, cleans with less detergent and water and is so easy to operate."
1.0,"""WORST FRONT LOADER!!!""","Had this machine delivered and a little over 2 weeks later it started a slow leak from the door. Lowes swapped it out for a new one and the very next day on my 3rd load, the same thing happened and also every time I start a new load I have to empty the water from the area where you put the detergent in. It was FULL of water. The first machine didn't do this - UGH!!! Now they are sending out a repairman to adjust the door!!! Which shouldn't leak in the first place, it is 1 day old! NOT HAPPY AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND SAMSUNG! Can't wait"
5.0,"""Amazing Washer!""","This washer is amazing! Incredibly easy to use. The quick wash only takes 26 minutes. It's very, very quiet. The audible alerts are a bit annoying, but I keep them on so I know the thing is working. It really makes no sound at all except at the very beginning and end of the cycle as the drain pump works.It does come with 2 rubber fill hoses, power cord and a drain hose. But I definitely recommend getting stainless steel braided fill hoses that are guaranteed not to burst.This is a VERY heavy item. The delivery cost (if applicable# is worth it!The only Con to this particular item is that the door is NOT reversible. It opens from right to left only. This renders the ability to reverse the door on the matching dryer #565990 electric or 565991 gas) completely useless.While not really a pro or a con, it does take some getting used to the time it takes to wash a load. The quick wash is 26 minutes; but a heavy soiled, steam wash, extra spin, extra rinse will take 3 hours and six minutes."
3.0,"""a year later-not so sure""","the soap dispenser keeps water in it-it does not always drain. tech can't fix. I live in high humidity and the plastic dispenser (where you put soap, bleach, fabric softner) always molds and so does the rubber seal. it is impossible to keep clean. I would not purchase again in an area of high humidity. also, a hand wash feature would be nice."
5.0,"""Love it!""",Very happy with this purchase. Quiet operation. Easy to use controls. Love the clean cycle; no more buying washing machine cleaner and no more smelly washing machine. Love that it reminds you every 40 loads so you don't have to remember to run the clean cycle.
1.0,"""Dont buy samsung""","Excessive mold issues, mold internally that you cant see unless you disassemble the drum.  Major part failure at only 5 years, a know defect that samsung customer service ignores but knows very well.  Look at the pictures.  That is mold inside the drum, you cant see it unless you disassemble the machine.  The corrode part has an inch thick of corrosion, finnally cracking.  Repair was $400 by a technician so I had to do it myself.  Do not buy a SAMSUNG.  Look at the pictures, there is a pic of the replacement part.  Our clothing was being washed in this mess.  Also, all the internal hoses were full of mold and smelled horrible."
5.0,"""Amazing Washer""","I bought this washer just one week ago and have already used every cycle it has. I can't believe this washer - best washer I've ever owned. It is quiet, efficient, and as far as quality goes, it has my previous washer beat in every department. I had a Whirlpool and it went out 3 times in just over 4 years. So we went with this Samsung because of Consumer's Reports reviews and we aren't one bit sorry. Recommend this washer to anyone looking for quality and not a huge price tag. For those who say their washer is noisy and walking across the room - be sure all four corners are leveled with the floor and it does work best on a LEVEL floor such as concrete or tile. And be sure to read your operating instructions thoroughly because a front loader is much different from a top loader."
1.0,"""Very low quality""","Not long after we bought our washer, but just outside the warranty period, the latch on the door starting acting up. It cost over $300 to get it fixed. Just for a small little latch. Watch out for repairs."
2.0,"""Excellent in efficiency at the cost of cleaning""",We have now had this washer for 3 months and I have to say I wish I had taken it back. It work well in the fact that its capacity is amazing we rarely ever fill it to capacity. The spin cycle is really amazing compared to most washers that we have had. Clothes are practically dry before moving to the dryer and this is where the issue is. I don't think this uses enough water to even wash my cloths. Almost every load I have to rerun my shirts as they rarely smell clean and usually still stink of body odor.We have tried all kinds of settings but it just doesn't use a lot of water.
5.0,"""Don't hate on front loaders!""","After days of reading reviews from four different stores on top loaders & not being able to settle on one that had decent reviews, we ended up at our local Lowes who was finally able to fit us with a fantastic machine that would clean our family of four's clothes with ease. One of which, is a logger & comes home full of saw dust & mud on a daily basis. This washer does tend to become off balance for a few seconds causing it to become a little loud during it's spin out, but quickly comes back in balance & does a fantastic job! I never even wanted to look at front loaders due to so many negative reviews, but because of my husband's work, this is what was recommend to us. I absolutely love it!!! I plan to regularly clean it like recommended, I wipe down seals after every use, & keep the door open so air can pass through. I have also noticed you may have to remove the soap tray to wipe it out also."
4.0,"""Good Purchase with Reservations""","This Samsung washer is a large beast, and even larger mounted on a pedestal. Lowe's delivered and installed the machine which ran well during the install test. However, the machine rocked and rolled unacceptably during the first load: a California king fleece blanket. Because it was the only piece in the machine, the drum action caused the blanket to wind over on itself, so at the end of the cycle, the center of the wound up blanket didn't seem to have been washed.A second load, with more pieces, produced a better wash, although the machine vibration persisted. A few days later a Lowe's technician adjusted the machine, tightening it to the pedestal. He said that the pedestal mount is not as stable as having the machine sit directly on the floor, so some vibration was inevitable. Also the machine was built to handle heavy loads, and a small load would cause some unbalance and result in some vibration. My next fuller load was better.So here's the skinny: level all sides of the machine, tighten it securely to its pedestal if you purchased one, and wash large loads. We're keeping ours."
5.0,"""Great product, great service!""","I've only washed a few loads so far and I haven't had any issues, nor would I expect to this early. I am concerned about the extremely low water levels but apparently this is normal and the machine is operating as it should. Clothes come out clean and smell great!I was even more impressed with the online ordering process with Lowes. This particular washer and dryer set was out of stock at my local Lowes but the town over had them so I ordered them from there. Less than 24 hours later, I was washing clothes in my new machine that Lowes delivered, setup and even tested before they left. Super great service!!!"
1.0,"""Dont Buy SAMSUNG""",Bought this washer less than 18 Months ago and just had to spend almost 600.00 in repair costs. Took almost 3 weeks to get a Samsung authorized repair person to look at it.
1.0,"""If you want to repair an appiance get this!""","Regular home user with 2 kids. My last washer lasted 17 years. I usually never buy a extended protection plan. But for some reason I did get the plan. IT IS A GOOD THING I DID. This has been down more than once. Each time, it was fixed under the plan. BUT, it takes a week to get the repair man over, and then 2 to 3 weeks for the parts, if available (one time they were back-ordered, but I could find them online although they would not use those for the repair --NIB), and then another 2 to 3 weeks for the actual repair to be done. This cost me $90 a week to take my laundry to a local laundromat. So the overall cost on the third breakdown, I could have got a new washer that would not break as often. Look elsewhere. AVOID SAMSUNG. If you have to have it, get the longest protection available!"
5.0,"""Amazing and CLEAN!""",I am extremely satisfied with our purchase. We ordered this washer and dryer and both pedestals in the merlot color its absolutely stunning. The clothes come out SO CLEAN even on the quick wash cycle.We have Dogs and 2 Kids so we use the Sanitize mode a lot even though it takes 2 hours to wash the clothes come out stain free and i know that any bacteria is gone. Im so happy. We love you SAMSUNG XOXO
5.0,"""Great value with one minor issue""","First I would easily recommend this washer. Its very quiet, easy to setup and easy to use. The quality is what I would expect for the price. Only issue I see is the door. When I purchased this I was told the door is reversible. It is for the dryer....but sadly apparently not for the washer door."
1.0,"""Worst Service From Samsung than Any Other Company""","I am very frustrated with my Samsung washer.  I purchased the machine one year ago this week and I've had the same issue the entire year.  I've called this issue 4-5 times and I've been unable to get any results.  My issue is the washer leaks from underneath and behind every few weeks to a month.  This is the real problem, their service is horrible.  The first time I called this in months ago, I was given a number by Samsung for a mechanic to call me to set something up. No one called, so I called him.  He told me he doesn't deal with Samsung because they never pay him for his work.  He stated he doesn't know how many times he has to keep telling them.  I then called Samsung again, and they told me they would have to locate someone else.  I received a call two days later by Samsung, stating they found a technician that could come out.  That didn't help either.  The tech that came out didn't even do anything.  He looked at the machine, and told my wife she is using to much detergent.  So we reduced detergent, with same problem.  We called this in again.  Same guy, this time, he didn't want to come out.  He stated it was the detergent.  Bottom line is the only issue is the washer has leaked and the washer is rated well.  The problem for you if you buy this and you get a lemon that needs service, good luck.  Samsungs service is horrible."
4.0,"""Important - if you STACK this Washing Machine""","Great units, with a couple of concerns if you stack them, and/or you are tight on space.  I really like this washing machine (and dryer combo).  The functions are great, many options, does everything I want and more, and you feel like you are using a fancy unit, to be sure.  I have not found any quality cuts yet, after 2 weeks of use.  I believe that Samsun will be a brand to set standards in the future, the effort is obvious that they put in on these units. 5-stars if they sit on a floor side-by-side.There are a couple of basic problems though.  Both are only around stacking the units.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND buying these units if you will be stacking them, but if you must stack a washer/dryer, below are the major things to weigh, before you buy these.  #1, the kit that you must use to stack/attach the washer/dryer, mounts the dryer on top of course, with about a 2"" RECESS backwards.  The clip ""bends"" far backwards, and there seems to only be 1 option.  I have a TIGHT washer/dryer space, it was a very big deal to install these units.  You will NOT be able to stack these units with less than 39"" of clearance, in order to close your closet door.  And that is only if you find the FLAT dryer exhaust vent.  Fully honest, below is 37.5 inches from the wall, and I had to do some hack-SAWING on the flange that comes out of the rectangle-vent pipe, and also SHAVE quite a bit out of a 4-inch spot on my wooden closet door.  These were last minute decisions, and when the door is SHUT you cannot tell that I butchered my closet door.The 2nd major thing is that an average woman height cannot see the controls on the dryer, that is IF you stack the units.  Step-stool required.  I measured 77.75 inches total, when stacked.  I took a picture from a height of a person that is about 5-feet 4 inches. See for yourself.  I am almost 5-11, and the top of my head comes to the top of the dryer glass-circle.I guess that the bottom line is, that I am greatly enjoying the washer-dryer.  We spent quite a bit more than our modest budget on these, so I confess that we feel like it is worth the step-stool hassle to use fancy units like these.  It may be difficult to read displays on EVERY dryer on the market when stacked.  Just saying."
5.0,"""One of the best purchases ever""","The Samsung washer/dryer combo we bought is one of the best purchases ever. Bought it on sale so it was cheaper than buying a ""stacked"" combo that we replaced. We live in a condo so space is and noise was a consideration. The washer is amazing quiet compared to our old one, washes pretty big loads (>15 towels) and after the spin cycle most things are almost dry. Great value as Lowe's delivered them and set them up for free!!"
1.0,"""not worth the money""","Bought this in 2011. I do less than 8 loads a month. Is broken beyond repair. Had electrical panel problem. Samsung charged $400 to ""fix"" it. Still not working. Now they tell me it'll cost $700 for parts for new ball bearings to make it spin! Not worth the money."
2.0,"""Front load washer""",I bought my first Samsung front load washer and matching dryer from Lowe's on 8-1-12 installed.The washer is now banging or knocking (I think it's a drum bearing going out). The dryer has a knocking soundbut can't see anything wrong with it. I'm now spinning an extra 15 min. to get the water out as it won't spin out the water the first time around.Machines still look brand new. I leave a rag in the door of the washer to stop any odors from starting up and have never had a problem with that.I added pedestals and they are worth every cent.
1.0,"""Dead on Arrival""","Pre-ordered washer and dryer pair to have delivered two days after our move into our new home. The washer and dryer were delivered and installed they gentlemen that installed it started it on a quick wash to ""set up"" the machine. The machine's 26 minute quick wash stopped with 18 minutes remaining and will stay that way until it is turned off. Thinking it was a fluke, we restarted the machine and it stopped working at the same exact time. The machine will not spin out what so ever. Rinse + spin will soak and toss the clothes around until it is time to spin and then stops all together. So unfortunately we called Samsung for help. They told us to calibrate the machine this should take 1 to 3 minutes.... the machine will attempt to calibrate to no avail but doesn't  succeed.  So day 1, only a few hours into ownership of this oversized, overpriced sharp looking paperweight, yielded 3 phone calls to Samsung and 2 calls to Lowes. No one will send a technician out to address the problem, they offered replacement of the machine, ETA 75-90 days from now..... Living in Rural NH driving 30 minutes away to a laundry mat is not an option... This overall experience has left one heck of a sour taste. Should have stayed with the small family owned businesses I typically support and this whole run around would have been easily diverted."
5.0,"""Best Washer""","This is the best washer I've ever had the pleasure of using. Lots of setting choices, it's quite, it's quick, and you can even have it play a song when it's done! The kids even find it easy to use."
5.0,"""Best Washing machine I have ever had.""","My old washer was one of those top loader no agitator types. Knew as soon as I did a load of white clothes that it was awful. The sheets always came out twisted into knots.My new front loader is so easy to use and the whites came clean on the first wash.I did a load of sheets (king size) and they came out wonderful. (not twisted into knots)I have used every feature so far except the sanitize cycle, haven't needed it yet.I really like how much water is removed in the spin cycle.My old dryer doesn't have to work so hard."
5.0,"""Great so far""",Owned for less than a week but so far I'm impressed. Went through 2 LG front loaders in the last 5 years so there is no way I was forking over the cash for another.This machine is much quieter with less vibration during the spin cycle than my previous washers so the VRT seems to be adding some level of balance to the load.Samsung washers appear to be ranked #1 for customers choice according to JD Power so this machine is a good buy especially if you catch it on sale.
3.0,"""Leak issue""","Overall, we like this washer. We have owned it about one year now. Lowe's installation was ok, and the men did a fine job. The only problem we ran into was that there was a leak underneath the washer about 7 months into the install. The warranty covered the issue, but it does reduce our confidence somewhat that we won't have other short term problems down the road. Also, these units are heavy. Ensure you place a water drain pan underneath washer before installation."
5.0,"""Very good purchase. Nice features. Easy to use.""",Not my first choice but Associate worked with me and decided on this model. Within 24 hours of old machine failing I had new washer installed and working. Using several cycle choices and very satisfied.
5.0,"""Finally Got New Machines!!""","We purchased online and picked up in the store... was scheduled to deliver from store but fell on a holiday weekend so we decided to get them earlier. Lowe's was fast pulling the item and helping put them in the truck.My husband and I installed them and it's very difficult doing this with 2 people, and I am a pretty strong woman! You will need 3-4 people to help unwrap and lift them out of the styrofoam they are in.Other than that the install was easy!Only Con is that the hoses that come with it are pretty cheap (the cold water one leaked). Luckily we had pretty expensive ones on the old machine and just used those!PLEASE READ INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USING WASHER!!! We didn't and didn't know there are ""shipping bolts"" in the back (3 to be exact), and it made the spin cycle move and bounce the whole washer sideways... and that thing is NOT light. So luckily we did no damage because we turned it off right away and found the problem.Color is beautiful like red wine, and they are super quiet... I recommend!!"
5.0,"""Love this washer""","I previously had a Samsung that I loved, but sold it when I moved. So when I was looking for a new washer/dryer, Samsung was the only brand I would consider. This washer is quiet and does an excellent job in cleaning our clothes. I'm not sure I will use all the functions, but for the price, it has a nice selection. I color is pretty and looks nice in the laundry room. If you wipe the drum and seal after you finished washing you won't have any problems with it smelling musty. I also leave the door open overnight to make sure the inside dries. Theres a small amount of vibration if you have heavy items (like towels) during the spin cycle, which is normal."
3.0,"""Nice Washer But..""","We purchased this unit about 11 months ago and it seems to work fine. The only nagging issue I have at this time is that the fabric softener compartment empties the softener into the drum with the laundry, but is left filled with water at the end of the wash cycle. This is very frustrating to resolve. I've been sent a replacement part which didn't help. A technician has been dispatched & replaced all of the compartments to no avail. I wish I had picked another front load washer. It looks great and has many features, but this little problem is like having one fly trapped inside your house that keeps buzzing around and you can't get rid of it."
1.0,"""Flooded my garage within 1 month of purchase!""",Bought this on 12/29/15 as of today 1/19/16 it has flooded my garage. Unbelievable! Waste of money and time!
1.0,"""Horrible performance""",Have had issues with this washer from the beginning with the spin cycle. It takes 3+ hours to wash a load of laundry. Even empty it has trouble balancing the drum. Do not waste your money!
1.0,"""Do Not buy Samsung""","I purchased the same model about 5+ years ago, and just like other people, the spider flag (the main shaft of the drum) has corroded, hence the machine is unusable.  Called Samsung and they finally agreed to pay for parts, but not labor.  Anyway, the machine is fixed (but not balanced properly), and guess what, in 5 years will have the same issue, because the replaced the parts with the same part that was corrosive again... very disappointed, the hassle I went through, and the poor quality of the part I mentioned.  I would not buy this product has for the amount of money you pay, and it only lasts about 5 years...."
1.0,"""High efficiency garbage""",We've had the washer and dryer for over a year now and they are complete junk. The washer uses such a small amount of water that clothing barely even gets damp and items have to be washed multiple times on 3-hour long wash cycles just to get the clothes even remotely clean. You can't bleach ANYTHING because there is no soak option. We have to fill up our bathtub with water and bleach and soak whites in the tub prior to washing them in the machine if we actually want the items to look white/clean. Then we have to wash them multiple times just to get the bleach smell out. There are dozens upon dozens of videos online complaining about the very same poor experience with this washer. Only wish I saw them prior to making the purchase. DO. NOT. BUY.
4.0,"""Design on display is not good for being stackable""","The design on the unit of the display is at an angle. If you stack them, it is really difficult to see the display unless you are really tall. I'm 5 8 and can't see it. I had LG at my last home and their display is straight and can be seen."
1.0,"""warrning look on consumer report""",so upset I bought this washer under the pre tense of a lows employee that it was a great machine. 8 months after owning it started to act up thank goodness I paid for the extended warranty as 2 days after the 1 year warranty it would not work it was getting stuck on 9 on the clock and washer smelled bad. so I decided to look up Samsung vtr stuck on 9 and it BROUGHT up hundreds and hundreds of complaints about the same problem and how Samsung just treated you BAD as they are doing to me now PLEASE PLEASE LOOKup Samsung before you buy its A BAD COMPANY for washers. im hopping Lowes does something as im a business owner and I spend a lot of money with them we will see if they reach out. AGAIN DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG
4.0,"""So far so good.""","I've only had it a week, but I am very happy with the design, operation and efficiency of this product. It is far quieter than my previous front loader. The steam feature is nice, and produces great results on the allergen setting, however it does add a significant amount a time to the cycle. I am able to do a full load with just a small amount of HE laundry soap. This is the most efficient front loader I have owned so far. Only time will tell if it remains durable."
1.0,"""Drum and Door Liner  has orange/brown residue""","I have had this washer for about 2 years now. The Drum and Door liner gets very dirty with a orange/brown residue. Running the Self Clean Cycle does not clean it well enough, there is constantly a orange/brown residue inside. I have to use a toothbrush and cloth with bleach about once a month. If I do not do this thorough cleaning the residue ends up getting on white clothes, if you do not catch it before you put your clothes in the dryer it gets baked on. I also have noticed it has gotten very loud and rattles badly when the spinning cycle is on (yes it is level and so is my floor) I have had other front loading brands before and this one is the worst, I would not recommend or purchase again."
2.0,"""Frustrated and Disappointed""","Our 15-year old Kenmore washer finally broke down 2 weeks ago. In 15 years, this is the only time that the washer has had any issues. I considered ordering parts and repairing the old beast, but was convinced to get a new one. Now that I've made the purchase and the old one has been taken away, I'm left questioning the judgement of those who suggested I replace the old machine. After completing this purchase last Saturday, they were able to deliver it on Monday and now on Friday, the brand new unit isn't working and it seems to be a problem with the drive unit. We did manage to get 2 loads of laundry done since it was delivered, so now instead of being two full weeks behind on laundry, we are only like 13 days behind. On top of that, they can't have a technician look at it until next Thursday, so I have to wait another week to use the set we just spent close to $2300 on, or head to a laundromat. These may very well be the last Samsung products I ever purchase."
1.0,"""Regret Buying!""","We bought the washer and dryer combo a few years back. I have replaced the heating element in the dryer along with the belt. To this day it still does not dry our clothes all the way without having to start it over a good 3 times! The washer always has different letters on the front for Now flow or any other problem that goes with it I have replace FOUR parts on it. I had a tech come out 3 times within the first 6 months of buying the set! I will never buy another Samsung appliance again! I have spent so much money on this dang thing because it was the right color and I thought the front loads were better, Now I don't even want to buy another front load Samsung has completely ruined them for me!"
5.0,"""An Excellent investment""","After looking and reading many reviews on several different brands of washers, finally decided on this Samsung. We had a high efficiency washer before, but this one takes that a couple of steps higher. The machine is quite, does not walk, is quite adapt at figuring out load weight and adjusting the spin cycle. You should know that using he quick wash cycle, the machine does NOT weigh the load.  This is important because if you're going to wash something like towels or jeans in a quick cycle the machine in all likelihood will vibrate and as a result will walk some.  Which brings me a glaring issue found in the instruction manual. The manual states that when you are going to wash a load using the ""normal cycle"" you open the door of the washer, press the power button, load the washer, add detergent and any other products such as bleach etc., close the door and then press start.  If you follow those directions the washer WILL NOT weigh the load and it will result in the washer vibrating during the spin cycle.  When getting ready to wash a load, regardless of what it is, DO NOT POWER ON THE WASHER WHILE THE DOOR IS OPEN.  Load the machine, add the detergent, close the door and then press the power button followed by any changes in the wash cycle you wish to make and then press the start button.  In the normal cycle you will see the drum rotate a number of times while the display panel will show a series of rotating lines.  This means that the machine is weighing the load and will then be able to automatically adjust itself for the correct spin to keep the machine from vibrating.  This is a great washer. It's smart and will do a terrific job.One other note.  When you use the ""self clean"" cycle, be aware that this is a FOUR HOUR process. Yeah, I know, crazy amount of time.  So it would be best to use it when you are going to bed."
1.0,"""Only one week and the door won't lock into place""","I have only had this unit for one week and already the locking mechanism on the door is either broken or has parts that have come lose. The ""male"" part of the lock is lose, like it hasn't even been tightened down with the screws and I cannot tell if the ""female"" section has issues but bottom line, not a good start and I can't recommend something that tanks after only a week."
4.0,"""a little wobbly""","The controls are easy to use and the extra features are very nice. It is a little wobbly in the spin cycle even with perfect leveling. It doesn't seem to balance the load as well as a conventional washer. Overall, very happy with the product."
1.0,"""Samsung a Dud!""",I purchased a similar model just about 2.5 years ago and just past the normal warranty period it failed.  The problem is the last part of ANY cycle.  A 45 minute cycle has ran anywhere from 4 hours to overnight (just testing to see if it would ever stop).  Typically it has ran 2-3 hours on any cycle if it ever stops.  Sometimes it does stop but the clothes are dripping/wringing wet.  It goes through this balancing period of tossing them back and forth which seems like it should then it starts the actual high speed spin to complete the cycle.  Sometimes it barely gets to spinning it it tosses loud as if they are out of balance then starts to toss to balance again.  It is usually in the last 10 minutes of any cycle but as an example it could display 4 mins remaining.  It may finally get to a high speed spin that appears it's finally going to complete the cycle.  Spinning hi speed.  No indication of any imbalance and quietly spinning.  It will suddenly stop spinning slow to zero RPM and immediately add time back to 12-18 minutes then go through this vicious process again.  Samsung support was WORTHLESS.  First time there was no reply and the second attempt is reply with simply pointing to the manual to troubleshoot.  We paid in the $800 range for this washer and it is a worthless pile. We didn't buy just to have a new washer but to replace a good old fashioned washer (which is near impossible to find anymore) that lasted about 15 years and was half the price or less.  I would expect to get the same time or more out of this type of washer but barely got two.  I'm turning away from most of Samsung products of any kind mainly because of their lack of support.  We just purchased a GE dryer to replace one that quit after 20 years of use so I'm hoping for a better experience and therefore a better review of that product.  Bottom line we are DONE with Samsung!
4.0,"""A little disappointed""","Love the color of this washer. Its quiet & does a good job getting your clothes clean. I also love that it does not ""walk"" like my Kenmore did. My Kenmore also was getting unbalanced alot. I have not had that problem once so far with this washer. My Kenmore was 8 yr old but it had to be bolted to the floor to fix the ""walking problem & the unbalanced problem was not fixable unless you put in more items & started all over. The one thing I cannot believe anybody has mentioned is the self cleaning cycle that TAKES 4 HRS AND ONE MINUTE TO COMPLETE!!!!!! Did they say this washer was energy efficient? Talked with the company a couple of times but they say this is right. So I guess it takes half a day to swish water around in your machine to get it clean. Sorry can't believe that's energy efficient."
2.0,"""New But Not Good""","We have had this washer for less than a month. It has only been used about 12 times. Today, the Quick Wash setting quit working and locked up the machine with wet clothes in standing water. I was able to to switch to Rinse and Spin only to recover the clothes. NOT IMPRESSED. BTW, just returned a high dollar Samsung refrigerator that never worked out of the box. REALLY NOT IMPRESSED!!!!"
1.0,"""I will NEVER buy from Samsung again""",We bought this product on April 30 and a piece of rubber broke off on May 27.  We immediately called for repair and were told 2-3 days.  After 6 days I contacted them again and they said another 2-3 days.  It is currently June 5 they say this morning it will be June 19!  I have four children that change clothes often-this is completely unacceptable!
1.0,"""Big Problems Right after 2 year warranty expired""","I bought this washer in February 2015. It's not getting heavy use - perhaps 2-3 loads per week. In April 2017 (26 months of use), the Heavy Duty cycle is unusable. The power cuts on and off (no display), it restarts randomly etc. After 5 hours of trying to finish a load that was supposed to last 1 1/2 hours, I finally gave up and pulled the clothes out. This happened with 3 different loads. The other cycles are still working, at least for now, but I won't be surprised if they have problems soon too. Of course, the warranty just expired. It's too much money to buy these to expect big repairs two years in."
1.0,"""What a Joke!!!""","Purchased Samsung companion high-efficiency stackable front load washer and Dyer under three years ago.  Both worked fine for two years, then washer kept blowing codes.   We were able to trip code by draining the washer for a few months.  The drain was clear may I add.  Then it stop turning completely.   Repair came out and dx the problem was code related to timing error.  It took three weeks to get the part.  When he came back, it blew the drain code.  Another two weeks for a part.  When the repair man dismantled the machine, he discovered the drain was totally rusted, the bolts were unremoveable and had to be broken.  The  computer card was cracked for the time related problem.   I am 67 years old with no dependents other than my husband.  Point being, I am not washing a dozen batches of clothes a day.  I am sorry I trusted Samsung.   Waiting for the dryer to blow-up next."
5.0,"""Great Washer""","This washer is very efficient and my clothes come out clean every time. I'm still getting used to the HE washer and how little water it uses and the fact that it takes longer to wash a load. The trade off is that it gets so much water out in the spin cycle that dryer time is cut way back. It is a little difficult to get items out of the washer at the back. Mine is not on a pedestal so I have to bend down and stretch to the back to get everything out. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning."
5.0,"""Clean Clothes? Absolutely!""","Well, this is the first front load clothes washer I have purchased. I got it home, unloaded and connected, and my wife started a small load. WOW! we both stood there and watched it run a complete cycle. This machine will definitely lower the water bill and with the more efficient, quieter than a whisper direct drive motor, electric energy as well. Unless you have very soiled clothes from working in the yard, etc., the short cycle (26 Min) cleans quite well. The machine also has a self cleaning cycle to clean and sanitize the shiny stainless steel drum periodically. I do not think you can go wrong with this unit. It is practical and entertaining."
2.0,"""Uncontrollable Vibration""","Like many I've read here we have uncontrollable vibration and noise issues from the washer.  It's leveled per instrucitons on a tile floor.  All the packing screws are out. On spin up nothing but walking and screeching. We've tried rubber pads and mats but to no success.  This is not just the last front loader, but the last Samsung ever for us. It's less than two years old.  On top of that even though we let the door stay open to dry and use monthly cleaning tablets there is still mold buildup in the soap dispenser."
5.0,"""So far so good""","Have only had for a few weeks. No problems so far. Great black friday pricing. Much better than our old agitator. Easy to use, clean look, fairly quiet compared to our old machine."
5.0,"""I can't get over how quiet it is""",I am very pleased with the dilervy drivers . Very well manners an explain things to me. Thanks again
5.0,"""Great washer""","We just purchased the washer and dryer and so far so good. They are both very easy to use and very quite. We did not need the stands and they are still very accessible. This is our first front loader machine, but we did our research and this one was worth the value. All we have is Samsung products and they have not dissapointed us yet. Our laundry room is right next to our bedroom and both machines are very quite."
1.0,"""Poor Quality""","We are on our 2nd washer and it is also out of round. We have had this one for 2 months. The technician basically said it would need to be completely torn apart and put back together. Totally unacceptable for a new Washer. We spent $14,000 on filling two houses with Samsung products and we are also getting ready to get a different refrigerator too because it still doesn't work after three service calls. Samsung has been a real let down in our new home. We are now trying to rid the entire house of the product as nothing is working right."
1.0,"""Avoid Samsung Washers!""","I hope my review will help people avoid what I have gone through.  First of all I purchased a Samsung top load washer and barely a year after I purchased it it stopped spinning out.  Thankfully a recall was issued on the washer and I was able to return it and get a replacement.  However, there are two options....both options require your out of pocket to begin with.  Option 1 is to get any brand replacement model for up to $548...you make the purchase fill out the paperwork with receipt and they send a check in 5 - 6 weeks.  Option 2 is an incentive for Samsung loyalty and you make the purchase of a Samsung machine...still submit all paperwork, but you get up to $637 back.  Now I was not sure about Samsung, but I was willing to give it another try.  I mean I did have problems with what is now a recalled machine and they are trying to make good on it.  Even though I have to shell out the money first I will give it a go.  So yesterday I took delivery of my brand new Samsung front loader.  I was so excited to do laundry...I live way out in the middle of nowhere and my laundry was piling up for over a week waiting.  It was delivered, installed, rinse+spin cycle ran and calibrated...like the manual shows and all before the delivery team left.  I put in my first load...a load of towels.  5 minutes into the wash the machine starts flashing on the panel and playing music like it does when it starts or finishes.  I called Samsung and they had me unplug the machine for a reset.  Then restart it and told me if it happens again to call Lowe's because the machine was just delivered that day.  Okay so I start the wash over and it is putting in water and moving around some but not enough water to swish the cloths around but I know these are HE machines and I have faith.  Then I come back and there is an OE error for water level sensor.  What in the world.  I change the machine to drain+spin.  It drains and NEVER spins.  Just continuously trying to drain for HOURS.  I call Lowe's and they call me back today for the S/N.  In the process I chat with Samsung today.  They tell me to check the drain filter for debris...HELLO it is a brand new washer first load!!!  They say they will send a technician out.  Send a technician out for a brand new machine????  Thankfully Lowe's is going to switch it out.  However, I have to wait a week before they are back in my area again.  The contact at Lowe's assures me that they sell a lot of these machines and maybe I just got a 'lemon' so I am going to replace with the same model and cross my fingers that it actually works.  However, be warned.  Samsung is terrible at making washers and they do NOT care about the consumer or making it right.  If they did then they would want to replace the machine from the get-go.  I will be doing a quick wash before the installers leave on the exchange machine!!!!  Thank goodness Lowe's stands by the products they sell."
1.0,"""Awful don't buy""",But this and the dryer is a combo the dryer had problems in less than a year and the washer broke in less than 2 years would cost me more to fix it then it would be to buy a new one Samsungs have awful products my Samsung refrigerator broke also
1.0,"""DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU NEED TO STACK !""","IF YOU NEED TO STACK ANY OF THESE SAMSUNG WASHER AND DRYERS THESE ARE HORRIBLY DESIGNED INSTRUMENT PANELS!  Seems most of samsung models have the tilted panels that you CANNOT see when they are stacked unless you are 7 feet tall (no exaggeration my son is 6'5"") because cannot see the panel with the angle unless you are on a stool!  Customer service told me to unstack them to repair the problem when the ONLY reason I purchased was for stacking !"
1.0,"""Was good for 20months...""","Up until today I would have given this washer 5 stars.  We are less than 21 months into it and it has stopped working.  Our old Maytag lasted 20 years!  The washer has great features, but is VERY poorly made.  After researching on you tube, I see there are lots of people having the same issues!  Samsung customer service is a joke!  Spend your money on something on a brand known to last, not the one known to fail !!"
5.0,"""Good Washer""",I have had this washer for over 2 months and have not had an issue. I am careful to wipe it down after each load and leave the door and the detergent tray open when not in use. My clothes have come out clean and fresh and my drying time has decrease significantly over my last washer.
5.0,"""Contemporary Design with good old fashioned work.""",We were trying to match our dryer we had purchased previously for a rental. We needed something of value and durability to withstand the extra use. It looks great and runs quietly. No more problems with leaks or anything else. Good product!
5.0,"""great front load washer overall""","This machine is quiet when running, does a great job on clothes, and is easy to select options and run. I'm overall very happy with this machine. To help others in their selection I want to note the following:1. The machine sits pretty low and the tub angles away from you, so you have to bend over and reach pretty far to empty out the items all the way back. This might be an issue for older people or those with limited mobility.2. Clothing in this tends to be more twisted than in my previous front load machine.3. Red color tends to show scuffs and scrapes a lot more readily than my old white one.4. My old machine was a 3.5 cf model and this is 4.2, but it seems to hold a LOT more clothing.I've had the washer for close to 6 months now, so have a good feel for how it works. Well worth the money I think, and I like that the door design does not collect water like the previous ones did with the accordian style."
1.0,"""SAMSUNG WF42H5200AF/A2""","We purchased this unit on March 27, 2015. We have had (3) electronic failures in the unit making the unit unusable. We have had (3) service calls to Samsung for the same repair. Samsung keeps giving us the runaround.  I would steer clear of this product, and others like it."
1.0,"""Looks nice but did not last!""",Brought a beautiful front loader that  had issues regarding the drum balance after 4 years. The drive shaft bent and the machine was useless. Cost as much to replace the drum and drive shat as to buy a new machine. These machines don't last very long and would not recommend them if you expect them to last 5 to 10 years. Very disappointed.
1.0,"""Too bad zero stars isn't an option""","This is the worst washer I have ever owned.  Water comes out of the fan on the back.  Repairman that Samsung sent says this is normal if you put too much detergent or fabric softener in or if you don't use HE.  I use Tide HE and if I put any less in, I would not be using any.  Leaks all over the floor periodically.  Worst $900 I ever spent and I own the matching dryer too.  Also bought a Samsung Fridge about the same time.  Last $$ Samsung will get from us.  I have had it 18 months and had 6 service calls all over this leakage."
1.0,"""Not a good washer""","From day one this washer did not work properly. I installed per the instructions and balanced it. From the very first run it made an obnoxious ""banging"" noise when spinning up. It banged so bad that the drum would push the door out. Once it reached full speed it ran smooth. I thought the load was unbalanced, then I ran it empty. Even empty it still banged like crazy at medium RPMs. That when I called Samsung....big mistake.Good news, the repairman was excellent. The bad new, Samsung claimed that the banging was perfectly normal even after the repairman said it clearly shouldn't do that, especially when empty. I decided to return this machine. I've read a lot of bad reviews and a lot of great reviews about Samsung. I won't buy a Samsung washer again. Not worth it. It was a huge hassle to make a warranty claim and then return this machine. Lowes did a good job and exchanged with no problems."
1.0,"""Worst washer ever!!!""","I purchased my Samsung washer about 10 months ago and it has been nothing short of a nightmare.  My first washer never worked because the seal on the door was faulty.  Lowes had to send someone out to make sure I knew how to operate the washer before taking it back. So after 2 weeks they finally decided to give me a new washer.  But Samsung special orders like this model can take up to a month to deliver. Another bad attribute about Samsung.  I got my second washer 25 days later.  Fast forward 3 months and the washer goes out again.  I bought the maintenance plan from Lowes and that could be the worst purchase I have ever made.  It has no benefit to the consumer AT ALL! There are a lot of loopholes that work in their favor and Lowes doesn't really care.  I made a big fuss to the store manager and he didn't really do anything.  All he said was that it was within the 1 year and it is up to Samsung.  Luckily, I did get the washer fixed and we were back to normal for now.  Now, here we today.  About 4 weeks ago, I got the patented ""4E"" message on the display.  So I call in again and they say that it needs a valve part to be replaced.  Appliance Advantage said they get a lot of calls on this, and to order the part it will take 3-5 days.  So time passes, they show up and say they do not move or unstuck the washer/dryer. I was at work while my fianc stayed home.  Instead of us rescheduling, she goes to get a few neighbors who just by chance were home.  And the lowes service advantage just stood there while 3 women move a washer. Very classy Lowes!!! They install the piece and it did not fix the problem.  So they said they needed to order another part. And that will take 3-5 days. So we go through all the above again 5 days later.  Install a new computer board and the repairman shorts out the washer and now it won't turn on at all. So then they say they have to order it AGAIN! But now I am questioning the competency of the repairman because he didn't even put the hoses back in the right places.So I call Lowes customer service, they tell me all the repairman have to do is to give me some paperwork saying it needs to be replaced.  So then I call Advantage appliance and they say no that's not the case, Samsung tells them what to do next.  So then I call Samsung and they say that is not true, they just need the repairman to call them and say it needs to be replaced.  In short, the maintenance people have zero interest in doing what's best for the customer.  Their job is to turn in as many tickets to Samsung so they can submit invoices.  Almost done, hang in there with me.  So after the 5th time, I go to Lowes store for a 4th time yesterday. While standing inside,  I call lowes corporate office and gripe to some poor soul where I demand the district manager's name and contact info.  While I am talking to them, the same assistant manager who didn't help me before is standing there with deer in headlights stare. I tell him that I am calling the district manager and I am going to tell him about my experience and the lack of customer service I have received.  I also told him that the Advantage appliance phone number was disconnected and I simply had enough! It was only then did the manager say he would take back my Samsung setup including the dryer and replace it with a Whirlpool that has the least amount of service calls.  In short, do not buy any Samsung appliance for long delivery times. Do not purchase the maintenance plan, it does you no good unless you have a spare washer laying around or you enjoy taking your laundry to the neighbors for weeks on end.  Be ready for Lowes not to help you unless you threaten to call the district manager."
2.0,"""5 YEARS!!??""","We purchased this product - Merlot Color - purchased both washer and drier December of 2010 - and loved it.  It worked excellent until June of 2015 when the dryer stopped working.  I had purchased the extended warranty but of course could not find the paperwork and couldn't find it - both Samsung and Lowe's told my husband they had no record of the Warranty.  So we paid $300 for someone to come and fix the dryer - apparently it needed a belt.  Then in December of 2015 the Washer stopped working -wouldn't drain.  Called for warranty assistance, again nobody had any information about my extended warranty so we paid the same guy $350 to fix a pump.  In February 2016, I received a letter regarding renewal of my Samsung Warranty!!!!!  The one that we had that just expired in Dec. 2015 that nobody had any record of me purchasing.  At that time the 3 yr Warranty cost the same as the Washer which was on sale at the time.  I purchased nothing and did not renew -- low and behold, my dryer sensor is now going out.  Are appliances really only supposed to last 5 years?!?!?  Don't think I will shop at Lowe's or purchase a Samsung product again.  So disappointed. :("
1.0,"""Broke in two months""","The washer vibrated excessively since we bought it, I tried leveling it a couple times and after running the calibration the water stopped flowing into the machine.  This is two month after purchase.  The only worse than this washer is Samsung customer service.  The do not respond to you.  They say they will, but in the end they do nothing.  Luckily Lowes is willing to help."
5.0,"""Loving It!""",I love the ease of loading and turning on the cycle. With the press of a couple of buttons the technology takes over. The washer even plays a little tune when finished. I am loving the Samsung washer! Hope it lasts a long time!

1.0,"""Samsung front-loader washer with steam cycle""","I PURCHASED A SAMSUNG HIGH-EFFICIENCY FRONT-LOADER WASHER WITH STEAM CYCLE.  THE LETTERING CAME OFF AS I WAS LIGHTLY WIPPING THE CONTROL PANEL WHERE SOME DETERGENT HAD DRIPPED.  I CALLED THE 800 # AND FOUND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO BUY A WHOLE NEW PANEL AT A COST OF $80. THEY DO NOT HAVE A DECAL TO FIX THE PROBLEM. SO NOW I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA IF I AM WASHING WITH COLD, HOT, OR WARM WATER.  ALSO THE LETTERING TO CHOOSE WHAT WASH CYCLE SELECTION IS WEARING OFF.  IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT SAMSUNG WOULD  MAKE A PANEL SO CHEAPLY, AND I DON'T THINK THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY $80.00 TO CORRECT SAMSUNG'S PROBLEM.  I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT AGAIN."
2.0,"""Don't Buy!""",I bought a Samsung 5 years ago. Tub cracked. The tech said it happens often with Samsung washers. I called Samsung to see if they would help me in anyway (about a $600 repair) and they said no way! They were even rude to me!!! No thanks! Consumer Report has it wrong on this one.
1.0,"""6 Months...Then Kaput!""","I bought this washer on September 8th on Lowes.com. It was delivered to my local store for delivery/installation to me, which occurred within the week. It has worked well (it replaced a similar model I had for almost 6 years...that should have told me something right there). The settings cover everything I need, and it has good capacity; that's why I reordered the Samsung. Well, on March 18th, midcycle, it just stopped. My wet towels are now locked in there. In fact, I can't even access the serial number needed by the technician because the sticker is located inside the door. Now it will be 7-10 days for ordering of parts. Lowe's mentioned a loaner in that event during our call the other day, but that's only for extended-warranty people (not me), even though it's still under Samsung warranty. Laundromat time? Nit before warning others that these Samsung washers have a life span of under 6 years...or 6 months...depending on your luck. I'll never, ever buy another one."
1.0,"""DO NOT BUY - HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE""","BAD IN THE LONG RUN & HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! When I purchased this washer, I read the great reviews and was happy with my purchase, at first.  Then our washer slowly got louder, until it sounded like an airplane was taking off from my laundry room.  After multiple calls (note me calling them and them not returning calls) we had a service person out and said we needed a new drum.  Samsung agreed with this, until we argued & proved that they needed to pay for no and then the washer didn't need this anymore but only a repair.  The repair fixed things for a while  about 8 months later the washer started to get louder and louder.  And now we are back at an airplane taking off in our house.  We placed multiple calls and emails to Samsung, being promised a return call the next day, the return call happened once and resolved nothing but another promised return call.  We have called them each day for 5 days with no resolve.  Today we were told that they would send a service company out the next day to repair.  The service company called my husband to set up a visit (1 to 2 weeks out, not the next day) but said they wouldn't schedule unless we provided a credit card number as Samsung noted in the file we would be paying for it and they wouldn't schedule until this note was updated by Samsung.  They also recommended we get the promises made by Samsung service in writing since they don't back their promises.  We called Samsung to request this and were told no being provided the notes from our file, that it was confidential.  Then when we asked to be transferred to a supervisor or someone else, we were told no.  We then called back and spoke to another customer service rep who also told us no on transferring and that we would have to wait for a call back.  So now we are waiting for Samsung, yet again."
1.0,"""Shakes, loud, won't balance. 2nd unit same problem""",It has a hard time balancing loads is loud and shakes.  20 days in the Samsung repair man that looked at it said it had balancing issue but nothing he can do to fix it(just keep adding more items mid cycle...don't think so) and it is probably just a design flaw. Said I could try to exchange it but new one may have same issue (it did).  Returned the unit hoping it was just a defective one (Lowes has best 30 day return policy with no questions). Unfortunately new one has the same issues.  It vibrates excessively with the rubber door molding shaking as it tries to balance and get up to speed.  It makes noise like it is about to fall apart.  Sits on the same part of the cycle for 5 minutes or more as it can't balance. So a 114 minute load takes 15-20 minutes longer.  Do not buy.
1.0,"""JUNK-DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY""","We purchased this washer, it has been the loudest washing machine ever owned.  Less than one year later it quit.  Samsung certified repair comes out multiple times to fix it, then determines it is not repairable.  We are now 77 days with out a washing machine and still trying oto get our money back from Samsung.  Never again will Samsung get a dime from me."
1.0,"""Don't buy this one""",We had this for less than a year and bought the extended warranty and it stopped working.I had a repair person com out and deemed it not repairable after four times coming back. Now Lowes extended warranty people has denied my claim stating that a repair guy had to come out four times for the same problem HE CANNOT FIX IT!   Not sure what else I can do!  Paid way to much for it to stop working prior if a year!
2.0,"""Smelly and lasted only 5.5 yrs""","We bought our Samsung front loading washer from Lowes about 5.5yrs ago.  I'll be generous and give it 2 stars because up until a few months ago, I liked the washer.   Here's 3 issues to consider before buying...  1. It's smelly: Up until now, I loved the washer...it was nice looking, ran smoothly but I do have to say it's almost ALWAYS had a mildewy smell.  I'd say it started smelling about a year or two in.  I read a couple years back that this is a typical issue with front loaders in general.  I think it was something to do with the way the barrel sits.  I mean, I run the clean cycle (""pure cycle"") I wipe down the rubber molding, clean the filter, leave the door open to air it out...nothing really seems to get rid of the smell completely.    2. Pieces break: About 3 months ago, the plastic door latch just shattered to pieces.  I couldn't run a cycle because the door wouldn't lock.  I looked on youtube for repair advice and luckily it looked like something I could fix.  So, I called Samsung, ordered the part which took 5-7 business days to arrive, watched youtube and fixed it myself.  It wasn't too bad a fix (about $50) but I did have to peel the rubber away from the door and get into the machine to remove the existing latch and replace the new one.  3. Doesn't last/expensive to fix: About 2 weeks ago, our washer started to make a LOUD rumbling sound toward the end of the spin cycle.  It rocks and rolls and makes a whole bunch of noise that we can hear throughout our 3,300 sq. ft house (similar to an airplane landing) with the laundry room door closed.  I googled the issue to see if I could repair it myself but according to reviews, it was mostly likely the bearings were worn and I'd basically have to take apart the whole washers to fix it.  I called two appliance repair services (one recommended by a friend and one I found on google), explained the noise and both of them said that it wouldn't be worth the service fee for them to come out because it's 98% likely that the bearings are shot and it's easily an $800-$900+ repair.  I called Samsung and of course they said that there isn't recall on my washer and that  this isn't a common problem (even though if you google ""Samsung loud noise during spin cycle"" you'll see, there are plenty of people with the same issue).  They gave me a couple things to try: clean out the filter and take off the water hoses and clean the little screen inside each connection.  Did that and ran a couple loads.  No improvement so now Samsung recommends I have it looked at.  The dilemma were faced with is spend $100s of dollars and TRY to fix it or look into a buying a new washer.  If we have to get a new washer, I'm going to file an official complaint and we'll probably go with a top loader, and definitely not a Samsung.  I believe a major appliance should last more than 5 years."
4.0,"""Don't make them like they use too""","I've had my Samsung 7 years and almost 2 months. The bearings has gone out and will cost about 1,000.00 to fix. Sorry I can buy a new one for around  $800.00. Can't fought the machine it's done a great job from what i'm hearing is the machines today last about 5 to 7 years. DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THEY USE TOO.To many plastic parts. Guess i'll be washing machine hunting.  Oh by the way if you'll drain the hose on the front of your machine let it air till the next wash day it'll never smell 7 years and never had that problem as I always do this."
1.0,"""Bounces around the room on spin cycle""","I'm 54 and have been doing laundry since I was 9.  This is the WORST washing machine I've ever seen.  We bought it for our vacation home, as we have a Kenmore front load in our primary home.  But this thing is JUNK, on medium or high spin, it is so noisy and bounces around the room. We tried a carpet, didn't help, I'm loading it back in the truck and returning it today!"
5.0,"""N""",There is no review to accompany this rating.
5.0,"""Great washer for a year now""","This has been an absolutely trouble free washer for a year now. No smell, no unbalanced loads, nothing, just clean clothes."
1.0,"""Long term reliability poor""","After four years our our 4.2 cu ft front load machine machine had a catastrophic break down.  burning rubber black smoke poured out from a bent drum shaft/bracket/bearing.  Samsung agreed verbally to pay for labor and sent out a local repair sgent.  Once reporting back problem, Samsung refused to pay for any labor and would not offer any rebate or other resolution.  The bent shaft problem can be seen on the web."
5.0,"""HE convert""","I realy had a mindset that I did not want an HE machine - my old one works just fine - thank you! But, when my washer bit the dust after 15 years - I bought one because I liked the color!! Ok, not a good reason, but I really liked the merlot finish. But, this machine does a great job on cleaning the babies clothes - with a toddler and a creeper we have lots of dirt, food and things we don't even know where they came from on thier dresses and outfits. This machine cleans them and they are brighter than they were after going thru the old washer. The only thing I don't really like is the time it takes to run a load which is about an hour for a standard load."
5.0,"""Excellent purchase. Product delivers as promised""","I was doing two loads of wash at least three times a week, now it's accomplished in two loaders once a week! Water does tend to stay in the soap/softener dispenser but just removing and wiping it out is no problem. Quiet, clothes cleaner than ever. Haven't used steam function yet. Great product!!!"
5.0,"""happy with purchase.""",We looked at a variety of stores and decided on Lowe's. We had a very nice and knowledgeable associate. He took his time to explain the product to us. I was thrilled with the delivery people. Would have much rathered had a lowe's associate.
1.0,"""Stay away from this washer""","Stay away from this samsung. Sold hour house and the buyers wanted the washer and dryer. Bought this washer for new house after having previous samsung for 3 years with no problems. What a mistake. Returned 1st one bc it was making an awful squeaking noise when going into a spin cycle. 2nd one sounded like it was tumbling rocks a month after we received it. Literally sounded like it might explode. Decided to give samsung one last try and returned it for a 3rd. On the first load, 3rd one began squeaking horribly any time it spun and the drum was bouncing up and down like it was not held in properly. None of these issues were "" normal"" sounds or vibrations by any means. Needless to say, we're done trying with samsung.  Lowes has been extremely great through this process. We are exchanging our entire set...washer/dryer/pedestals for a different brand. Do not buy samsung. You'll only have problems."
5.0,"""Updated Review""","When I last reviewed this dryer, I had very little positive to say about it.  The tumbling continually turned any size sheets into a ball, and I would stand in front of the dryer during the entire cycle, unraveling the ball so the sheets would dry.The dryer was replaced by Samsung, and delivered again by Lowes.  This dryer is a DREAM.  Dries quickly.  The steam function certainly removes/prevents wrinkling, although clothes do NOT come out looking ironed."
1.0,"""Knock around ,and leaking.""","Stay away from this model washer, but the dryer is good."
1.0,"""No service available in Northern Michigan""","When I purchased My Washer & Dryer, Lowe's told me they always had service readily available. When the washer broke, Lowes gave my an ""800"" number to call. The Service Center does not have anyone within 100 Miles. I guess I will go back to Sears for appliances."
1.0,"""Leave at the store!""","Owned the washer and dryer set for 7 years. Replaced 3 heating elements and 2 drive belts. Between this and our Samsung refrigerator I advice every one to stay away from Samsung, even their phones.  Bought the washer, dryer, and the fridge new when we moved and have had nothing but issues. Very disappointed."
1.0,"""Only 2 years old and major problems""","Spin cycle never ends, just keeps adding time.  The 30 minute cycle to over 2 hours to finish.  When the spin cycle gets to a high speed the washer really vibrates and the spinning shuts down. I think this is a safety feature - unfortunately it keeps trying over and over and never ends.  Clothes come out soaking wet. Looks like a common problem - just do a Google search."
1.0,"""No soak feat, semi-cleans, creates extra wrinkles""",So disappointed! One year in I regret this purchase.- This washer does not have a soak setting. The only thing you can do is adjust the soil level. Sometimes that is just not enough!- It uses too little water. Sometimes the bedding has dry spots when I pull it out. - I have never had to iron/steam so much. Leaves items super wrinkled. Overall it does not clean very well. I constantly have to use stain remover. Never had that happen before.I wish I would have not just picked it because it came in red. I should have paid more attention to the features.
1.0,"""Beware of Samsung""","Please go on the internet and review Samsung washers! We got a 350 model--well we inherited it from a house we recently bought--it's only 2 years old and it's a real piece pretty piece of junk. High end, more expensive model keeps going off balance, rebalancing does no good, does NOT get the clothes clean and sinks constantly. Yes, I've tried Allfresh, Tide washer cleaner and bleach--each 2 times since we've been stuck with this model. The smell keeps returning. This machine is a money pit. If you research Samsung's so called higher end, higher quality, higher efficiency washers you will learn a lot! We are going to replace this washer with something simpler, as the settings are way too complex and so many things to go wrong! You will also learn that Samsung has had many, many complaints to various consumer advocate agencies about their hype versus reality. I also owned one of their huge refrigerators. The ice always collected frost and stuck together in the ice maker because their engineers didn't have the smarts to have a small gadget close the actual ice maker (not the door opening), so every time you open the refrigerator door, air goes right up that ice maker shoot and good luck breaking it apart because it works the motor like mad trying to break up the mess. Just do your research before buying anything Samsung!"
4.0,"""Decent""",Good product and sufficient to do most loads. Doesn't really work well with heavier loads.
1.0,"""Be forewarned""","No matter how big or small the wash load is, when the cycle stops, the clothes are in a knotted mess. I've tried putting tennis balls in the machine to ward off the result, but that didn't work. I contacted Samsung and after 10 months, they have had no response. For what I paid for this machine (and the matching dryer, which has the exact same issue), I should not have this problem. Clearly, the design is faulty. Save your money and buy something else."
1.0,"""poor engineering""",purchased this type of dryer 6 years ago and two of those years it was in storage. The drive mechanism (Y shape brackets seen in window above) corroded and failed. the motor bracket is $90 but the new tub is $500 and the drum is no longer made. this is a general problem with all Samsung washers.buyer beware
1.0,"""A ""Disposable"" washer by Samsung""","Bought comparable matched set in 2008 from Lowes. Worked well and the a relay on the washer main control board went bad. Samsung NO LONGER has the part available! Long story, but I fix appliances so it is not like I don't know what I am doing or where to source parts. It actually cost me money as a/the authorized part supplier insisted the number I gave them right off the board was not a good one and told me there was a substitute. They sent it to me, it WAS the wrong part, THEN they told me because it was an electrical part they couldn't take it back. AFTER SOME DISCUSSION.... got them to take it back, but I was charged a restocking fee. Additional research confirmed part not available/made anymore. Now Samsung says they warranty the motor parts for 10 years INFERRING it will last AT LEAST that long. What good is that warranty if they don't make CRITICAL PARTS (such as master boards etc. for at least 10 years as well...  thereby FORCING the consumer to dispose and buy another...basically selling disposable appliances..I SWORE I would not give Samsung the money for the replacement, but looking at the replacement options (such as LG and Whirlpools which strangely share some common parts) at purchase time, getting a Samsung replacement and not having to buy an OVER PRICED drawer, was a best financial option running the risk I could run into the same scenario with the replacement..."
5.0,"""Great Washer!""","In the months we have had this washer, our whites have gone from dingy to bright.  The house doesn't shake when it spins and it is quiet.  We use Sanitize a lot because I am handicapped and don't always make it to the bathroom in time.  I have no idea about any other models or brands but that feature alone makes this washer worthwhile.  I'd buy another if this one dies and I highly recommend it to others."
5.0,"""Thrilled""",great looking. Excellent features. Love the quietness. The doors are kinda awkward because it opens towards the dryer and the dryer opens toward the washer.

5.0,"""Exceeded my expectations!.""","I purchased this Washing Machine because my Dad has one and I liked the way it operated. I used his a couple of times because my own WP top load was useless since it continuously became unbalanced as soon as the spin cycle started.  This machine however, balances itself so that was a plus. The fact that it is a front load means that all of the clothes get washed evenly. And since everything is now High Efficiency and less water is used that makes a big difference. Another plus is, there is no agitator to worry about wearing your clothes out prematurely. This machine also has the steam wash feature and it is great. I have had this Washer now for right at a month and I am thoroughly pleased. I work in an Industrial environment (Pulp Mill) so my work clothes get their share of abuse (Dirt, Grime, Grease, Sap, Pitch and various Chemicals also). With just the recommended amount of detergent my clothes are cleaner than they have been since purchased.   I will also be purchasing the matching Dryer unit soon."

5.0,"""I REALLY LIKE THE MERLOT TWINS""","Let me just start by saying I love tools or I should say I love tools that work really well. I will say before I continue my review that I had the original set for 10 weeks until they were replaced by a new set because the other ones were vibrating pretty badly but in my opinion that had a lot to do with the installation. I did two months of research before choosing the twins. And for most of that time I was looking at Toploaders because the reviews said you have to keep the front loaders door open so it dries out. And I have to admit that put me offer a little bit until I realized that I always leave my Toploader washer machine Open after it's finished.My new twins are a dream and are living up to my expectations as to how they should operate when they're working properly. For This review I""m talking about the washing machine it runs super smooth and quiet. What I didn't really Count on was how much better my clothes would be cleaned. My whole life my experience has only been top loaders so this is my first front loader experience. And I got the pedestals mainly for the storage convenience. And they put them at the perfect height for transferring clothes from one to the other. You'll see in the photo I got a little crazy with the painting of the room so as to give the greatest contrast to the merlot color. I will probably have to tone it down my wife thinks it's a bit much. The washing machine really does spin them so well that the dry time is shorter. And I'm sure everybody can relate to this when we've left them in the dryer and didn't take them out the clothes were a little wrinkly. I just put them through the wrinkle away mode and it worked great. And it is really nice to be able to turn off the notification sounds."

Therefore the dryer's pipes length are set and can't swap dryer to the right side of washer. I was able to reinstall the dryer's door to open from the left side. But the washer doesn't allow you to reinstall the door to open from the right store. Therefore, I can't toss my clothes from washer to dryer directly. I have to bend up and down to take the clothes out of washer and lift above the door to toss it into the dryer."

4.0,"""It's been a good washer""","When my 14 yr old top loader died, I was reluctant to purchase a front load washer but I'm glad I did. It took a while to get used to the fact that there isn't much water in the drum, but my clothes do come out clean. I typically use the Normal cycle & select appropriate soil level, but the Bedding & Quick Wash cycles are good too. I've only used the Sanitize cycle a few times because it requires more time (that I don't usually have). Love the gray metallic color & the pedestals. MOST IMPORTANTLY -- when my washing is complete I ALWAYS leave the washer door open for at least 24 hours so it can dry out. I've never had an odor or mildew build up even though I live in a high humidity state. Have only needed to use the Self Clean Cycle a couple of times. Hope this helps!"
5.0,"""WOW! I am impressed!""","I have owned two other front load HE washers, complete with all the ""bells and whistles,"" but by far this new Samsung washer beats the competition by far.

The previous wash was ""normal"" with ""hot"" chosen for water temperature. I could not change it from ""normal"" to ""delicate."" I tried unplugging the machine and letting it sit for a few minutes before plugging it in and that didn't help. I wound up washing cloths on the ""normal"" setting and after the wash was finished, it allowed me to change the setting to anything I wanted. I downloaded the Smart Care app to see if I could connect with the machine to solve the problem (this machine is supposed to be blue tooth capatible) but my phone could not find the washing machine. The phone indicated there might be a problem with the internet or internet security setting, I don't have a problem with any of the other 10 internet-connected devices in the house."

5.0,"""Super Clean and Quiet! Makes Laundry FUN (almost!)""","This is my first front loader washing machine. I had a nice quality top loader brand new and matching dryer for the past 10 years when suddenly the washer quit. I was forced to purchase a new washer and was not intending on buying one at this time. We decided to go with the front loader for several reasons including efficiency and economically.First off, installation was easy as pie. Simple hookup as the same as the old top loader.I didn't understand what people meant by saying it cleans your laundry better until I was folding my fresh laundry after being washed with my new Samsung front loader. I actually smell the fabric softener. The clothes feel so soft and I can actually see and feel the difference in my clothes! They are cleaner and I can smell the difference. The clothes are so soft. I did not purchase the dryer at this time because our dryer works fine so we will wait. I was so impressed because since we had the brand new set 10 years ago, the dryer would sense the clothes were not dry at the end of the dry cycle and go on extended time EVERY load. Now that I have this new efficient front loader that extracts more water, my dryer is working FASTER! I am so happy! I will probably get the matching dryer soon to see if that can amaze me also!The only reason I did not give 5 stars for design, I wish the door had the option to open to the right."

The adjustable feet make leveling a cinch and I haven't had any balance problems.  Cons: I wish the lettering on the control panel was backlit for dim basement conditions.

Once it died I went onto the consumer review website and saw that this model was one of the top rated ones. I was looking for a high efficiency and high capacity washer because I live on a farm with 3 girls and the amount of laundry I do in a week is absurd.  I am amazed at this washer. First its so quiet, I don't even know it's working. The variety of washing cycles is awesome and since I live on a farm the steam cycles are great in getting out tough stains. Plus when the clothes are done, they are almost dry which is great and another awesome money saving feature. The color is awesome and an added bonus because it really brightens up the laundry room. I really can't say enough about how great this machine cleans my laundry. I am very confident in my decision."

4.0,"""Good but needs some refinements""","This is our 2nd Samsung front loading washer and the first lasted 8 years with heavy use and nary a problem until one of the computer boards went bad and continually failed to drain the washer. The problem with such high tech designs and units is that it's darn near impossible to find a technician who understands what's related to what in order to properly fix it. The first tech did nothing more than drain the machine and declared it fixed. Of course, it stopped working with water buildup the next day. The second (different tech) said it was a pump problem and replaced the pump. The problem occurred as soon as he tested it which led him to conclude it was a computer board problem...with someone finally being bright enough to call Samsung. When these units work they work well. When they do not, it's not easy to get a repair done properly, or so it seems. Here is the design problem with this unit. The drain filter clogs or declares it is clogged AND then locks the door and stops the cycle until you manually drain and clean the filter, even if it doesn't need it. It does say on the filter door to clean it every two month. Sure as apples grow on trees, the unit locked up and didn't drain on day 60 of owning it. I've now set an auto reminder on my smart phone calendar to clean the filter whether it needs it or not every 60 days. Good luck!"

Also clean the inner part of the seal as debris will build up.If using pods versus liquid or powder, place the pods in the bottom of the drum versus the trays. Also make sure if you use fabric softener that it is well mixed and not lumpy or it won't feed through the tray."

When they replaced the wire harness they said they would have to come out again and bring other one. Who brings a bad one out. It looked like they had drug it behind a car. Long story short, Samsung sucks as far as customer service. Lowes was great and took the washer off my hands and credited me towards a new washer. Great service from Lowes!

At around the 4 month mark, I arrived home to find a load of laundry still going in the machine after starting it hours prior. The machine was malfunctioning in the spin cycle, never reaching full speed, and continuing to add rinse water. Repair technician visited, and ordered new ""computer."" After a week waiting for the part, technician returned and installed it. As soon as he left, we tried a load, and the problem persisted. Waited for another service appointment, and the technician rediagnosed. This time ordering a new drum and shocks. Meanwhile, it was weeks later (3 service calls later), and our dryer was working overtime with our soaking wet clothes. Samsung finally decided to give us 2 options. First was to reorder the same machine, which carried the same 2 month lead time and possibly the same problem. Second option was to return to Lowe's and pick out any washing machine I wanted, pay for it upfront, and when they delivered, they would pick up the broken machine and refund the purchase price. Great in theory, however there were NO comparable machines at the same price point. So in the end I was forced to buy a new, more expensive machine, more expensive warranty as prices had increased, and wait 2 weeks lead time for delivery, all the while paying out of pocket until the eventual refund. This whole experience with Samsung and Lowe's has left scars on my heart and drained my livelihood. This, along with reports of exploding Samsung products across multiple categories and bad experiences I've had with their tvs, and I assure you I will never buy another Samsung product. And I will be shopping for larger ticket items at Home Depot, where I've had better experiences in resolving issues. On a somewhat positive note, both the repair technician, as well as the Lowe's sales associate were extremely kind, friendly, and helpful. Without them I couldn't have survived this process.*(For reference, I reside in an all adult household. And this happened over the summer/fall when normal temps in my area are 100++. No big bedding, or heavy thick clothing. I also came across a review for the machine on another website, where someone else had the same problem and experience that I did. This tells me that it wasn't a fluke, and that Samsung is not aware of a solution to this particular malfunction.)"
2.0,"""No power after 5 days of getting it??""","Wanted one of these for so many years.  Finally broke down and got the set.  Dryer works well, but this washernot so much!  Had it delivered and did one load of laundry.  Five days later I wanted to do another load.  Hit the power buttonnothing!!  Hit it again, still nothing.  Hold the power button for a few seconds and still no power.  Walk away and 5 minutes later I hear it.  It turned itself on all by itself!  It must have selective power and goes on when it wants to.  I tried unplugging it and using another outlet, hitting the breaker, still no power.  It is either a bad cord or a bad control board but after not even 1 week of having it???!!!  For a $600 washing machine I expected much more.  I bought this to replace a washer and dryer set that I bought at another appliance store that cost $450 for THE SET and that lasted me 17 years with only 3 repairs in that entire time!  I expected much more at this price and from Samsung.  Lowes is replacing the washer this weekend but I think now I'm buying the extended warranty because I am very scared as to what will happen next."
4.0,"""An Amazing Product""",I was really impressed with how this washer worked and how easy it was to use.
2.0,"""Only 7 years old and have to trash it""","We bought both the washer and dryer and paid upwards of $1900 for both. The washer has had to be repaired 4 times for various issues, the dryer 3 times. I take good care of my appliances and paid for what I thought was a good machine that would last as long as the cheap builder model they replaced. I was wrong. Now I am told the machine would cost over $1100 to fix so here I go to buy an LG which is the brand the tech recomended to me. He added that the life expectancy of the Samsungs is about 7-8 years."
2.0,"""Extremely noisy washer""","Was told this was one of Samsung's best washers, with the new VRT technology which would make it quiet and noise-free. It's actually the noisiest front loading washer I've ever heard. I have it leveled on a tile floor, with all shipping brackets removed. From the moment I started it up to do my first load and ever since then, it squeaks like crazy, and shakes and vibrates very loudly. Can hear it in the livingroom with the laundry room door closed and the tv turned up. When my girlfriend heard it for the first time she was concerned something was wrong. The washer has nice features and is easy to use, but the VRT (vibration reduction technology) is anything but that. I'm very glad I purchased the 5 year warranty because I'm beginning to think it won't last nearly that long. Needless to say, this will be the last Samsung washer I will ever purchase."
2.0,"""Less than 2 years old, Not worth the money.""",I have had this washer for less than 2 years. Normal use for a single adult with nothing heavy in it. 2 to 3 loads a week. Now the main chamber bearing is going out and getting worse by the use. It is so loud you can not talk in the laundry room. My LG washer lasted 4 years I was using it then sold it with the house. 2 years later they are still using it with no issues. Samsung had a recall on the top load for bearing failure but the front load is doing the same thing without a peep from them except it is out of warranty and you will have to pay to have it diagnosed. So much for keeping all the same brand appliances. I wont buy another Samsung product after this. Tomorrow it will be cheaper to replace it with a new one than get someone to fix it.
3.0,"""Maybe Okay""","We purchased seven years ago. Moved it twice short disiances. Operated great till this week. Banging and smoke ! Repair person stated it needed new drum and mount, $650 with labor. I think seven years is to short of a life span for a washer. Three person household for four years then two person for the remaining three. So I am looking for another brand."

5.0,"""Absolutely in love with this product!""",The only thing I miss from my prior set (stayed with the ex) is the hand wash option.
1.0,"""My clothes don't even get wet!""","I bought this HE washer after my old one died. This washer has a big barrel and should be able to washer a lot of clothes in one load. We tried to do this. The clothes come out and most of them are not even wet. and some a dripping wet, in the same load. I now only put a third of a load on at a time. What is the point of having a large barrel, when you have to only put in 1/3 of a load and wash it three times. My cloths come out smelly and dirty! I have to rewash everything! This is the worst washer I have ever had. Instead of making your washer so WATER friendly. Make them actually work! Also the cycles are extra long an hour and a half for ""heavy duty"", but even on the longest cycle, with hot water and on the ""heavy duty"" AND ""heavy soil"" cycles the clothes are not washed well. If I have to wash less cloths two and three cloths times, how is that being water, energy and time efficient? Also the self clean cycle is 4 hours. The time is not mentioned anywhere in the manuel. Make sure you do self clean over night, not during a busy wash day!!"
5.0,"""Great Product!!""",I am overall satisfied with this purchase!! My clothes come out clean and smelling fresher than any washer I have ever owned!! Time efficient and it doesn't take a lot of detergent to wash clothes! Looking forward to purchasing the matching dryer in the coming months.

The ""Eco-Warm"" cycle is a plus too to minimize your costs. Plus it looks good! The only drawback I see is that there is no pre-wash soap cycle."
5.0,"""3 months later""","We are overall pleased with the washer/dryer set. Initially tried to order the platinum color, but they were out of stock. We went with the white, which actually worked much better for the design of the room. Upon ordering, we bought bumper pads/guards as recommended. However delivery said we wouldn't need them. on tiled flooring. they were trying to help save us money, which we appreciated. 2 months later, the washer shakes quite a bit and makes lots of noise. its our only complaint. however, we think this is due to shifting toward the drain in the floor."

After receiving error code 5E again, I cleaned the door seals and attempted to unscrew the debris filter again. However, this time the filter cap did not unscrew and is now permanently stuck. The unit is now unserviceable without major disassembly. This is poor design, leading to poor performance, leading to poor maintainability."

I've already had to call/schedule repairs twice on the washer, which is unacceptable to me seeing as how it was brand new when I purchased it. Thank heavens I purchased the extended warranty! I will not be purchasing another Samsung washer. Not impressed. For something this fancy, and this expensive, I shouldn't have to deal with this. Staying home to wait half a day for a repairman, and not wanting to use the washer until the repairman looks at it. Inconvenient and worrying. It's new - what's going to happen when it actually starts to age?"

Sometimes the towels are plastered against the back wall of the drum and it's a long reach--sometimes have to get down on my knees. The pedestal would be a great idea, but that's extra $$, and the way my bathroom shelf is..it would be a tight fit.

So my review is not one of an expert or experienced washer purchaser. Overall I love it so far. I have had it about a month. Cons that I have noticed which may be with all front load washers:**The door does not open back far enough to be left open in my tiny area, therefore the washer doesn't really get aired out. I always left the lid open on my old washer and never had a problem with odor or mildew, this one concerns me.**We have not been able to get the washer ""leveled"" The level say its level but the washer still sounds like it is going to jump away at some points during the wash/rinse cycle:/**Our clothes seem to have a bad smell if they are left for any amount of time. A load in the old washer could sit for a day before I dried them!**Cold cycles take over an hour to run!**Because it has had to be moved out so many times to unstack and restack the dryer we bought the same day the plastic on the back leg has been damaged:( (1st dryer delivered with huge dent, 2nd controls pushed in, 3rd smoked and had a rattling sound and STILL WAITING on # 4 to come in.)  Pros **Love the cute tune that plays when the load is done**Love that the door has to be closed to start a load and locks after a certain point**CHILD CONTROL LOCKS!**My clothes are clean and it uses less detergent!**Super speed spin means less dry time**Like that it has so many options including quick wash**Love that I can wash my king size comforter in it!!!!

5.0,"""My 2nd Samsung Front Load Washer""",This is the 2nd Samsung Front Load Steam Washer. It has more steam features including Allergen and Sanitize with even better performance. I am very satisfied with the product and highly recommend it.
2.0,"""Seriously Concerned About Residual Moisture""","When deciding to replace my old laundry appliances, I did a lot of reading. I was aware that some people had mold/mildew/etc. issues with front loaders but thought that a simple wiping of the rubber ring after washer would resolve that problem. I care for my appliances so assumed I'd have no problems. No longer so sure.After the wash cycle is completed and the clothes removed, I wipe down the fairly wet glass/plastic door and as well as the rubber seal around it. I also wipe and leave open the compartment for the detergent and fabric softener, which are also wet. At this point I feel that the machine is far more high maintenance than the top loader it replaced. However, I wouldn't even mind doing the extra drying steps if I felt as though it would be effective but I don't. I think the machine has a stale or otherwise funky smell nonetheless. I've only had this washer for a little over week because I had to wait a month past the scheduled delivery date to get it (likely the fault of the retailer but double-check availability when ordering). Still, I've done lots of laundry in that time and fear the smell will get worse, not better. I have just done pretty basic washes and still need to read more in the manual. My impression is that there are a plethora of options but it will take some reading and time to be able to fully take advantage of all the settings.I did not purchase an extended warranty at the time of sale because I generally believe that when you pay a lot of money for a high quality product you should be able to depend on it. With respect to this washer however, I would strongly recommend getting the warranty if you decide to buy it."

The washer is super quiet and I even like the little tune it does when you shut it off. Before purchase, the salesman was pushing a different manufacturer on us as it has a placement for the door to not be fully closed to ""air out"" the drum and Samsung didn't have that. Well, I can close the door on the Samsung just like he could on the other brand and I have had no musty smell/residual moisture in the Samsung. I know I haven't had this product very long, but I would highly recommend it to everyone. Is my life that sad that I look forward to laundry day now?!"
5.0,"""Wow!!! I'm in LOVE""",I absolutely love this!!!! I wanted to wait few weeks before doing my review to properly test the item. And all I can say is WOW!it makes NO NOISE!

5.0,"""This product has Great features""",Just purchased a new top loader and dryer from Samsung 3 months before we put our home up for sale. Had to leave the new set with the sale of the home.

5.0,"""Great front loader so far""",I owned a Whirlpool Duet Sport set and bought it brand new than we had mold and spin and noise issues that we suffered with for almost 5 years than we moved and decided to purchase a new Samsung top load set. We owned it for 6 years and the 5th and 6th year was the worst because it was like it was about to explode. Samsung took it very serious and work very fast and they gave me a refund for the washer. Because my top load washer and dryer was in the platinum color I decided to keep my dryer that went with my old Samsung top loader and buy the platinum front load washer and it matches my dryer. I'm glad I gave a front loader another chance because I'm so happy with this machine except there's a lot more maintenance to go with it but still worth it!!!
5.0,"""My 2nd Samsung Front Load Washer""",This is the 2nd Samsung Front Load Steam Washer. It has more steam features including Allergen and Sanitize with even better performance. I am very satisfied with the product and highly recommend it.
5.0,"""I love the features on this washer""",I love my new washer. It is so quiet. I love the idea of being able to sanitize my clothes. It has so many extra options that you can add to each load. I also like that I can save the load that I use the most under My Load and just have to hit one button. I would highly recommend this washer to everyone.
2.0,"""Seriously Concerned About Residual Moisture""","When deciding to replace my old laundry appliances, I did a lot of reading. I was aware that some people had mold/mildew/etc. issues with front loaders but thought that a simple wiping of the rubber ring after washer would resolve that problem. I care for my appliances so assumed I'd have no problems. No longer so sure.After the wash cycle is completed and the clothes removed, I wipe down the fairly wet glass/plastic door and as well as the rubber seal around it. I also wipe and leave open the compartment for the detergent and fabric softener, which are also wet. At this point I feel that the machine is far more high maintenance than the top loader it replaced. However, I wouldn't even mind doing the extra drying steps if I felt as though it would be effective but I don't. I think the machine has a stale or otherwise funky smell nonetheless. I've only had this washer for a little over week because I had to wait a month past the scheduled delivery date to get it (likely the fault of the retailer but double-check availability when ordering). Still, I've done lots of laundry in that time and fear the smell will get worse, not better. I have just done pretty basic washes and still need to read more in the manual.

It has just started making a ticking noise at the final spin--not sure what that is. Clothes come out very clean.Dislikes: this is my first front loader and I am tall, so bending over and reaching in-especially way to the back of the machine is a pain. Sometimes the towels are plastered against the back wall of the drum and it's a long reach--sometimes have to get down on my knees. The pedestal would be a great idea, but that's extra $$, and the way my bathroom shelf is..it would be a tight fit. Overall, I like the results with my clothes, just the design could be easier for my situation."

5.0,"""Best washer and dryer I ever owned!""","Took a chance and purchased this washer and dryer last year after I heard alot of complaints about front loaders. I have to say I love everything about this set! My clothes have never been cleaner. My towels which normally came out wrinkly look like they are fluffy and new after being washed and dried! Its a beautiful color and look for my new home. There is a self cleaning mode on my washer. I leave my washer cracked slightly as I have heard about mold build up which has never happened. Would definitely purchase again! The only con I can find is unlike the top load washers, there is not a way to soak clothes unless you have a utility sink. Definitely take a chance and buy this set! You won't be disappointed."
1.0,"""Samsung Front load washers are inferior""","I bought my Samsung Front load washer from Lowes in 2012.  I will have had for 5 years in April this year.  My experience with this washer has been unpleasant.  It pops error codes constantly, and you are always have to start the wash over.  Had the repair service out while it was under warranty multiple times and it had multiple problems that were fixed.  The seal was bad.  the soap tray was bad.  The processor control card was bad.  It just had everything wrong and broke down once a year.  Well, it is out of warranty, and the Drum cracked.  This is an inferior product, beware!!!!!!!!!"
2.0,"""Purchase extended warranty""",I have had the repair shop work on my washer twice in 2 months .. 1st time leak somewhere in front of machine .. Tech installed new door seal .. ( didn't fix problem ) after tech disassembled machine and put back together the washer is very very loud on spin cycle . Round 2 is to find leak that is occasional and fix noisy spin cycle .. Samsung is sayin if they can't fix it this time then they will replace washer ..  Listen to video on spin cycle
3.0,"""Not for use in your living area.""","We did a lot of research on washer and dryer sets. Samsung has only been in the business making washer/dryer sets for a few years. We thought since we love our Samsung TV, that they would make good W/D sets too. Not the case. First we did tell our salesperson that it would be going in our Kitchen so it needed to look nice, be a certain size, and be quiet. We had them installed and first wash just about walked and knocked across our kitchen floor. We made sure was level and put pads underneath. Still was extremely noisey and wobbled all the way through the wash. This wouldn't make a difference if it was downstairs but it's not. It seemed like it had a hard time in the spin cycle. The dryer did not dry your clothes all the way no matter how long or what cycle you had it in. It had a loud vibration when IT was running. They also were much bigger in depth then what it says. We decided to reselect another W/D. We now have a Whirlpool and couldn't be happier. Looks fabulous, so much quieter, clothes get dry, and smaller in depth. Very happy now."

1.0,"""Nice washer but vibrates like crazy""",I bought this washer a month ago and I am very disappointed with the excessive vibration during the spin cycle. I followed all the instructions and installation recommendations to level the machine and it is still terrible. I have it installed on the second floor and now even my ceiling has cracks.Very poor choice to buy a front loader washer.
1.0,"""Samsung 4.2-cu ft High-Efficiency is a POJ""","Well, I'm on my 3rd one in the last 5 months.  My previous washing machine was a Samsung front load and it worked perfect.  Too bad it sold with my other house.  So I decided to replace it with a new Samsung front load and I've had nothing but problems.  It looks/sounds like the drum is about ready to bust out the door when it's running through the spin cycle.  I'm going to replace it with a different brand.  So bummed about this."
5.0,"""Amazing""","I've had my Samsung Front Loader for 7-8 years and I love it.  I do, on average, 20-30 loads per week!  So I'd say I've given the machine a real workout.  The steam function just quit, but I use it without (I have a techie hubby so he knew how to disconnect it safely).  I am just now thinking of passing on the machine, and I will buy another!  Never had a problem with mold, mildew or smell and the inside looks practically brand new.  We have very hard water where we live no problem there."
5.0,"""Samsung Washer""","We really enjoy the new Samsung washer we bought at Lowe's. It works great and is built very well. I believe that it will last a long time and fit our needs quite well. Can't say enough about the quality of this product. Also, had a very good delivery process. Guys were professional, yet pleasant and really knew what they were doing. Product was delivered very quickly with no problems whatsoever."
2.0,"""Our first front loader.  Noisy""","I'm not one to normally 'only' write negative reviews, but after having high hopes for this it falls short.The absolute great thing is the reduction in water usage.  OR more importantly, the small about of water it expels to our septic tank/drain field.  This solved a problem we were having.  Lowes delivery was wonderful as well.  One thing, normally they will haul off your old appliance for free, I think, but there was lots of confusion about it they would do that for us.  They wanted to charge us a fee.  But they took out old one for free eventually.  When you order online, it causes confusion as there wasn't a spot to mark that I wanted my old one hauled away.  After a call from the delivery people it was taken care of.  The washer looks great but is very noisy.  I guess I though they were supposed to be quiet.  This one squeaks every time the tub goes around.  and almost sounds like it's off balance.  Squeak.Squeak.Squeak.  This is whether it has a large load or very small one.  Maybe we got a bad one, and pretty soon I may call and have them come take a look at it.  They are Very Heavy, so look out for that.  I think he said around 300 pounds.  For cleaning, it does a great job and I like the low water usage and small amount of detergent you use, good for those with sensitive skin.  There are only 2 of us in the house, but our water bill went down $8 per month since purchasing this."

1.0,"""Samsung 4.2 piece of Junk""",What a terrible washer. Has broken twice inside of 1 year. Samsung customer service is useless. They have been very difficult to deal with. I just called lowes and they where nice enough to take care of it. It took the lowes lady over an hour on the phone to arrange a date for them to take a look at 4 weeks later they came. Even the Samsung repair man said they are junk. He is very busy. Do not buy. If you did purchase keep the original receipt. It's not a matter of if it breaks it's a matter of when it breaks.

My Front Load has many different washing cycles, rinse cycle, and temperatures to select from. It has a steam cycle that is absolutely exceptional and let's not forget the ability to sanitize cycle.

5.0,"""GREAT WASHER""",GREAT WASHER WITH MULTIPLE COMBINATIONS OF WASH AND RINSE. LOVE COLOR
4.0,"""Solid washer""",This washer fills the bill for a washer with a variety of features at a reasonable price.
5.0,"""Awesome""",I love this product.!!!! Very dependable and spacious.
5.0,"""Grateful for this washing machine.""","I looked at a lot of reviews before choosing this washing machine. I am happy with my choice. Two of my housemates use it at least a couple of times a week. It has handled a variety of kinds of loads. My third housemate who is blind has asked me to thank you for the sounds that he can turn on to accompany choosing the settings. Listening to the sounds makes the machine easy for him to use. When the machine is washing, it is much quieter than our old top loading machine."
4.0,"""Affordable, simple, quiet, stylish""","Simplicity is a very useful feature when it comes to using an appliance that one normally dreads. You push a button and it does the one thing it is designed to do. I'm glad to see that this washer gets as close to it as can be done. Should you need to select a wash cycle other than the default, there are plenty of options, or you can add your favorite as needed. Then, it's a single button operation again. Operation is very quiet, unless there are metal clothing pieces tumbling around in the machine, or the legs are not leveled and the appliance is wobbly especially during spinning. Steam is the only feature that one might utilize in addition to regular wash cycles. It works quite well and the price difference from a lower model becomes justified. Longevity remains to be seen. Original factory warranty (1yr) is too short, and is the main reason for missing an overall star. Customer service has not been needed or contacted so far. Hopefully it will remain that way."
4.0,"""all around great product""","nice and quiet, washes really good and spin cycles gets major part of water out of clothes to allow for less dry time. steam cycle get tough on stains out. great product for a very reasonable price"

5.0,"""Love my new washer""",We needed a washer dryer combo that was quiet enough to enable us to watch TV in the next room and this fit the bill nicely. I love all of the features and was quite surprised that we were getting them on a model that was this inexpensive. We have tried most of the different features and are very impressed. We have a stacked washer and dryer combination and are quite happy with them.
5.0,"""Samsung Washer""",This washer replaced my twenty year old washer. So far this washer has worked and cleaned my families clothes spectacular. I couldn't of made a better decision.

The washer was easy to set up and we also purchased a pedestal, which was easy to mount. Very happy with the value and performance so far!"

5.0,"""I would buy it again!""",This is the first washer we've ever purchased. We had to slam the lid down on the one that came with our new house in order to get it to start (sometimes multiple times) and this closes so easily and works so easily that I don't know why we didn't buy it sooner! I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
5.0,"""Samsung Cleans UP the Competition""","Cleans, steams and neutralizes my dirty laundry. I'm left with clean and fresh clothing. Short of ironing my clothes for me this is an amazing washer. It even makes pleasant music when a load is complete."

4.0,"""Very pleased""","Had this washer almost a year now, and am very very satisfied with it. The sanitize setting is exactly what my fianc and I needed as she is a professional chef, and I in the animal care field. Both of us come home with who knows what on us, but we are about to put our clothes in the washer and be confident that all the nasties are killed off. No issues with the washer, just purchased the matching dryer last week actually. Very happy with our washer purchase even a year later."
1.0,"""Don't buy""","I had a duet for ten years, but since most of my appliances are Samsung, I opted for this one. I really liked that it had a direct drive belt. Since owning this I had a repairman out within six months to replace an item he had to order. So we were without a washer for over a week. With my duet I NEVER had a smell, with this machine it smells horrible. I clean it as recommended, use only HE soap, and check the filter frequently. When you open the filter, by the way, water pools out everywhere no matter how much I try to control it. I never noticed there was no just spin cycle on it before until I need it. Now the washer door started leaking, and the door just burst open and flooded my pantry, garage, and kitchen. The only problem I had with the duet was someone pushed something up against the door and cracked it, but it ran great. everyone always remarked how great my clothes smelled with duet, but sometimes I have to wash twice now just to get clean. I have had this machine for just over a year. Also I did not receive drying rack with this product that comes with it."
5.0,"""love it so far""",We just bought the set of these and they seem to work great so far. We have only had them a couple of days. They are a huge improvement over what we had before which came with our house.

4.0,"""Great Washer""","This washer works very well. It is efficient on water usage which is nice. The only thing is that the door has started locking, I believe we inadvertently turned child lock on so have to read the manual to fix that. Otherwise, it fits a large load. I can do an entire hamper in two loads, which is nice. It also plays music when it is finished which is great. These are larger then we expected, so it was a little surprise and taller then they appeared in the store. Too high to put a counter on top, but would be great to put cabinets above."
5.0,"""Terrific Purchase""","The color is very attractive, the amount of clothes it holds is awesome, the app to tell me when its finished is handy, and it is especially great if you have lower back problems."
5.0,"""THE washing machine for any job""",This is a wonderful washing machine which handles any load with ease from delicates to workclothes to bedding.
5.0,"""Love Love""",My old washer just broke and I was in search of something new. Because I love their phones I decided to buy the washer and dyer as well due to all it can do. Overall I love it and love how fast it washes and how clean my clothes are after.
5.0,"""This Washer is efficient and works well""",I've only had this washer for 5 weeks so I don't know for sure how I feel about it. So far it seems to be doing a good job and I haven't had a water bill yet to see if it is saving me water or not. I will update my review after I've had it longer.
5.0,"""Sleek - Worth it""","We've only had the washer and dryer for a few weeks, but our quality of life has improved tremendously by not having to deal with the quirks and squeals of old appliances. The design is sharp, and even the sound effects make it feel like it's a premium set of devices. So far, zero issues. In fact, it works too well - the laundry is constantly done so it constantly needs folding! But really, it is worth it - get one (get both)."
5.0,"""Exceed expectations.""",Large capacity. Quiet. Easy to use. Like the steam feature.

5.0,"""So much room and many features!""","This washer is impressive because of its size and its many features. It has separate compartments for powder detergent, liquid detergent, bleach, and fabric softener. It also has a self clean option as well as custom temperature, spin, and soil level settings.

5.0,"""OUTSTANDING""","MY WIFE LOVES EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MACHINE ! GREAT DESIGN,QUIET AND CLEANS GREAT !"
2.0,"""Give me the good old washers.""","My clothes do not get clean. I've used different detergents and it makes no difference. It does not allow enough water to clean unless I wash one sheet, one pair of pants etc, at a time. Just as much water is used in four loads as would be used in one good load. One good load equals energy and time efficiency. Probably cleaner clothes, too, because you have more water. It takes water to clean clothes. I would like to be able to control the water level. The old machines did that. Who in the world came up the design on these new machines?"
5.0,"""Front load is better""",I like the tumble action of a front loader because it doesn't damage my clothes like a top loader.This model looks cool with the platinum.

It is very user friendly for anyone to use. it quite and energy efficient.  I love the fact that my Samsung requires less water and less detergent still getting my clothes extremely clean. My Front Load has many different washing cycles, rinse cycle, and temperatures to select from. It has a steam cycle that is absolutely exceptional and let's not forget the ability to sanitize cycle. I would definitely recommend Samsung Front Load washer machine if you are in the market for a new washer. This Front Load saves on water, electricity, and detergent costs. Samsung stand behind it products. I give the Samsung Front Load 5 stars."

4.0,"""new washer""","We had to wait for the washer to arrive. It took three weeks because they were on back order. We set up the washer on a pedestal because of not wanting to bend over. Great feature, however, the chemical dispenser is now quite high for my wife who has issues with her shoulders. Would like to have had a simple sheet recommending what selections to choose for certain items. Some of the features do not allow you to change the settings, which I am not totally satisfied. We have had some trouble with the washer wanting to ""walk"" on us. We did the correct calibration in the beginning. We will find a way to clear it up. The actual washing of clothes had been very good. So we find the performance of the machine to be an excellent feature."
1.0,"""This product had broken after two months""",It could not finish whole cycle and door was locked just used two months. Call customer support and mechanic spent four weeks to fixed it. One year warranty definitely not enough. I will not recommend it to my friends.

5.0,"""I love my new washer""",So far I am loving my new washing machine. I had decided to purchase a new one because my old top loader was not cleaning my clothes well enough. Often my gym clothes were left with a bad smell even after washing twice sometimes. With my new washer I put all my smelly gym clothes in a load together on the sanitize cycle and my problem is solved. Everything comes out smelling amazing.
5.0,"""Features""",Love the washer. The cleaning feature is the best where you don't have to add any chemicals to clean the asher
5.0,"""Proud Owner""",This product is a great investment. I have had the matching set with the pedestals and they are just amazing. I love the way the washing machine washes so fast and it can wash very large loads. The only issue I have with them is that they have some wobble in them with the pedestals on them. It is perfectly level on all sides with a level and it tends to be not balanced but it is level. Other then that i love them and would recommend them to anyone.

5.0,,There is no review to accompany this rating.
1.0,"""Won't Last""",This was my first high efficiency front load washer and was so happy when I bought it. Then it started getting louder on the spin cycle. You must keep cleaning filter to keep smell at bay and I recommend leaving door open for mildew is a big issue.  Now it is too loud to even run it and in the end it kept re-cycling and I had to manually cut it off.  Everone says it is due to the zinc parts corroding since up against alluminum parts.  Samsung says it only has a 1 year warranty. I am not a rich person who can replace appliances every 6-7 years.  I need them to last. I am laundromat bound.
4.0,"""great washer.""",Purchased washer a week ago and so far so good. Seems to remove stains and spins dry clothes better than previous washer. Pedestal should be included since front loading /unloading access is too low for me.
5.0,"""Very Good""","This is my second Samsung front load, the other was still working fine and was a bit smaller, so upgraded with this 4.2 @ Black Friday awesome price. This machine has great features, the Steam is great for whites, stains, tennis shoes and things that need deep cleaning. The option for added rinse, spin, pre soak are nice when needed. Front loaders do a very good job cleaning your clothes. I use HE detergent, and only a tablespoon for normal loads as I have soft water. Old top loaders used so much water and diluted the soap so I had to use more. This machine effectively tumbles the laundry thru a smaller amount of water and is gentler on the clothes. Spin cycle does well, and dryer keeps up with the washer on normal settings. As with any front loader, I leave the door open when not in use and have had no smell or mold with this or my last machine. If your setup doesn't allow for the door to be ajar, you may have a musty smell. I love the value, performance, and features of this washer. I hope it will last for 10 years, as nothing made today is made to last as machines were several years ago. My job is delivering appliances so I see all the names. There is occasionally a faulty unit, no matter who the manufacturer is. The extended warranty may be worth considering with ANY new appliance. This Samsung on sale was a great value for the size, and all the features it offers, and a solid performer."
5.0,"""Good price""",There is no review to accompany this rating.
5.0,"""Washing with this product is awesome!!!""",Gets the job done and doesn't take all day! The large capacity of this washer allows for a great quick wash. Everything's come out clean and fresh!!! Love Love Love it!! Custom built my pedestals and they fit like a charm!
2.0,"""Design problem""",I replaced this washer with the same style because it is exposed in the kitchen. The spider in back is known to fail because the design allows debris to build up and cause wear. Samsung needs to fix this design. I will not buy another washer from them until they do. The washer needs to be disassembled to make the repair. It is not worth it.
4.0,"""It is very easy to operate.""","I have only had my washer and dryer one day, but it runs very quietly and it is easy to operate. I am disappointed the washer door can not be reversed. Due to size of my laundry room it is very inconvenient, I am having to dryer door reversed. I may have to purchase the pedestals to make it easier to access the washer."
1.0,"""Excessive vibration, and the machine 'walks'""","Used a Miele front loading washer for 20 years. Smooth as silk. Had to upgrade to a larger maching, and, hence, bought this Samsung one. Brand new, run for 2-3 weeks. Experimented with all kinds of loads - no difference. At the highest speed, the machine smoothens out, but spinning up, to get to the programmed speed, it has a vibration intensity of 20 on a 1-10 Richter Scale. Machine is mounted on a matching Samsung pedestal. Samsung service personnel changed the four shock absorbers, which didn't make any difference. The vibration is so severe that the matching Samsung dryer, located next to it, also starts vibrating. And, the machine walks on a tiled floor, and moves completely out of its location until it is stopped by the adjoining dryer or cabinet on the other side. Pushing the machine back into its location, after each and every use, is hard, since it is heavy. And, without side access, it becomes even harder. The service representatives on the phone are polite, but there seems to be no record of previous calls. Have to repeat the entire history, calmly answer all their checklist questions over and over again, till finally they assign a service person. Don't know which is more frustrating - Samsung service or their appliance. The features of the machine are otherwise very good, and clothes get washed and dried well. With so much vibration, I am quite confident that the life of this product is going to be very short. And, by Murphy's Law, it will fail catastrophically after the 1-year warranty."
5.0,"""This front load washer is great""","Great price for the quality. Washes clothes without damaging them, and doesn't use more water than necessary, which is awesome."
5.0,"""Great Machines""",As of now it has been a great washer and dryer. I will keep updating as time goes by. but as of now no problems and it works just as a washer and a dryer should work.
5.0,"""Best Purchase Ever!""","I have never had a new washier or dryer. The have always been used or hand me downs. My wife and I decided enough was enough and went to purchase a new set. We ran into the Samsung 5200 series and the sale was awesome. I was able to get the Platinum colored ones, something i always wanted to do. Every feature fits our way of life. I actually ran the 1st loads of laundry. My biggest test was the King size down comforter.... the set clean it right up. The final test was my gym cloths that had been in my bag for a week...phew! when after using the sterilize mode clothes came out smelling wonderful. This is why I give the set 5 stars."
4.0,"""Exactly what I wanted""","We bought this pair after our VERY VERY old washer/dryer set ""died"". We bought the set in white because they are in the basement and we don't really care what color we purchased. I also opted to not spend the extra money on the pedestals because the price for each pedestal was ridiculous. I built my own perfect pedestal from 3/4 Birch ply, 2x4 frame and trim and baseboard molding; all for less than the price of one pedestal.  The washer and dryer function great! So far, I have not noticed an issue with the common water/mold/mildew on the front load rubber washer door ring. The basin drains very well and I leave the door ajar once I'm done washing everything.  There are plenty of wash and dry cycle options to choose from (possibly too many), but I'm not complaining. I'm sure I'll eventually use every one of them. The wash times are relatively quick, compared to my old machines and the machines themselves are quiet; though the dryer is a bit noisier than the washer, but not significantly so.  I read the manual and saw this ""Smart Care App"" feature, unfortunately our model only uses this to diagnose the error codes. I was hoping I would be able to get the ""Load complete"", ""load dry"" notification, but alas, I suppose I'll have to use my watch.  I love all of my Samsung appliances (laundry and kitchen and TV's). I will continue to buy them."
5.0,"""Best washer ever!""","This Samsung washer has surpassed every expectations that we had. It cleans very thoroughly and leaves clothes smelling nice and fresh. We really love the features that are built into the machine like; sanitize, allergen, and quick wash cycles. The steam cycle is very good if you have very dirty clothing that the stains will just not come out, and this option can and will take out those pesky stains from your precious clothing. We chose to buy this washer over the reviews of having a five star rating pretty much everywhere on the internet!. We also chose Samsung because of the J.D. Power and associates best customer satisfaction rating of any other wash brand. You will definitely NOT be disappointed in buying these pairs!!."

I honestly didn't think it would get my clothes as clean as a good old fashion top load washer with a agitator, My husband persuaded me to give this Samsung washer a try. I can honestly say that it has surpassed my expectations. It has all the bells and whistles that more expensive washers have but at a more affordable price tag. I am hooked! I actually enjoy washing clothes now and do not look at it as a chore. It gets my clothes cleaned perfectly."
5.0,"""great product""",bought this after i bought a top load whirlpool carbio which i had only two weeks because it wouldnt wash clean clothes traded it back at lowes for the samsung which nwas on sale fore the same price have only had it for a week but it will clean my dirty clothes great looking with many features so far so good!        l
5.0,"""Excellent choice for the price.""","First day washing with it. We wanted a quality High Efficiency washer at a good price. This washer exceeds our expectations. It's quiet and doesn't tangle or tear the clothes like the agitator washer did. Plus clothes dry a lot quicker because they spin dry much faster. Very nice machine.Would have gotten the one with the little door to be able to add more clothes, but it was 1"" deeper, and it wouldn't have fit (really)."
4.0,"""So far so good.""",I read a lot of reviews when searching for a new washer and dryer and decided on the Smasung. So far this washer has been awesome with the exception of heavy vibration and bouncing at the beginning of the spin cycle which settles once it gets into its full spin. I have leveled and re leveled it over and over and cannot get this to go away. Other than that it has plenty of room for large loads and gets everything clean the first time. I just wish that I knew what to do about the initial vibration. I wonder if it could have something to do with the base. I have posted a link to a video of this below.

5.0,"""AWESOME""",Replace old Samsung with this unit. So far we have used it 6 days and all the cloths are so so much cleaner and almost dry so that the matching dryer has hardly any thing to do. Would recommend highly.
3.0,"""Features dropped from prior product""",The Samsung front load washer we purchased in 2010 recently failed in the drum being attached to the motor had broken. We purchased a new Samsung front load to match the dryer that we had purchased at the same time in 2010. Obviously some of the looks on the front had changed since 2010 so not a perfect match but we decided it was close enough to stay with the Samsung brand. We did discover we had to purchase another base for the washer since the 2010 version would not fit the new 2015 model. That was an extra expense to throw away a perfect base and the bases are not cheap. The big disappointment in the 2015 washer there is no internal light. Why Samsung would not include the light in the 2015 design we don't understand. It is difficult to see if you missed any clothes in the washer unless you stick your head inside the washer. We also have discovered the first day the detergent dispenser leaves some detergent in the dispenser at times. It seems to vary. One time it's empty the next time it still detergent in the dispenser after the wash cycle has run.

4.0,"""Less than 2 weeks old and makes noise when draining water, wobbles even after having been balanced""","Overall this machine works great however; even after having balanced the unit on the pedestal it still wobbles at low speeds. The humming noise it makes when drawing water out of the unit is a little unsettling too. At less than two weeks old I question if these are noises it should be making.But again, it does the job it was purchased for. It cleans the cloths well, looks great and doesn't sound like it's trying to run away when it's spinning."
5.0,"""WASHER FRONT LOAD""",SO FAR VERY BEST WORK STILL NEED TO WORK MORE WITH ITEM
5.0,"""Awesome Washer""","Love my new washer, lots of features, design is beautiful, compliments my utility room better than that old white thing. Takes a little while for a load to wash, unless you use the quick wash. But I always add an extra rinse to my loads so it adds a little time. Does a great job on getting my clothes clean. Have no problem with bad smell coming from washer, but I leave the door open after I am done. I also wipe it down after done. Maybe because it is so new and want to keep it looking good. Quiet machine also, could hardly hear it just outside utility room door. Was beginning to think it wasn't washing clothes. Looked inside and sure enough it was running, just as smooth as can be. ."
5.0,"""LOVE THIS WASHER""",This is one of the best washer's I've ever purchased. It's beautiful sleek design looks amazing in my home. My clothes have never felt cleaner.
5.0,"""Samsung washer""",Easy to use. Many options for the wash cycle. Clothes come out much cleaner than my old top loader. Love it.
4.0,"""Has the features we wanted""",Have just installed and started using the washer and so far so good. Like the option of steam and a self cleaning button for the drum and seals with a reminder.Also like the easy access for the tub drain line trap.
4.0,"""Great, but louder than expected.""","We purchased this washer, the matching dryer, and pedestals six months ago. Everything is working wonderfully but the washer is much louder than I expected it to be. It is louder than our 12+ year old washer that it replaced. The rinse and spin cycles are very loud, to the point where I make sure to not do a load of wash while the baby is sleeping. We have spaced our machines a few inches apart, don't overload them, and have double and triple checked that they are perfectly balanced/level on the ground yet the washer drum bangs very loudly when it spins quickly. We have tried to fix the problem by selecting slower spin speeds, but that decreases the amount of water that is removed which increases drying time. I like the self cleaning feature, but it is also affected by the loud drum issue. It takes four hours to run that cycle so I would like to be able to turn it on before going to bed for the night, but because of the noise we have to try to remember to run it when we will be out of the house for several hours. Luckily, it is only once a month based on our usage (at least one load of laundry per day, 6 days a week). I do love the various cycle options, and that the display tells you exactly how long you have until the load is done. The song that plays at the end of the cycle is also a fun alternative to a loud buzzer. Overall I am pleased, but I wish it were a little quieter."
4.0,"""Looks impressive and a lot of great features""","Overall, I would give this one 4 1/2 stars. We love everything about it so far. My only complaint is the beginning of the spin cycle is louder than our old washer. The noise only lasts for 15 seconds or so. Perhaps the load is balancing as the washer drum is speeding up?"
5.0,"""Great washer, even at the lower consumer end""",Clean design and functionality. We had to replace an older Samsung washer and this model was the best one available in our price range. Quiet operation. Cleans well.
5.0,"""Love this washer""","I have never had a front load washer.I was a little reserved to by one as others talked about the moisture that stays in the drum.After talking to the salesman, he recommended propping the door open & leaving the soap tray open a little.I have been doing this and it is working just fine. I put a rolled up wash rag in the top of the door to hold it open.With that being said I love my washer."
5.0,"""Love my new washer but.....""",Really happy with our purchase! I love the washer and how well it cleans. One thing that I dont like it the fact that you have to buy the pedestals and that they are such expansive add ons for just a drawer. The washer is so low I have to get on my knees to get the clothes out which is taking a toll on my back.
4.0,"""So far so good!""","Just purchased this washer for a very good price and was excited when it arrived, very impressed with the color and chrome. A nice feature on this dryer is that during spin it will rebalance itself so its never excessively noisy."
4.0,"""Congratulations Its'a washer!!""","A decent washer. It has a great size handiling a good size load. Plenty of wash options, more than my wife and I, and most people would use. Not to loud except on the spin cycle. On the spin cycle it seems intermittent, start spinning then stopping, only to start again. The door sticks a little and even my wife thinks she is going to break it when pulling it open. Would love it to stay on delicates when powering up since it is our most common preference. All in all not to shabby of a washer for the price. Oh yeah and beautiful color!"

5.0,"""Finally, I Have A Good Washer""",This is my second front-load washing machine and I'm so glad to have this style back again. For the past four years I've had a top-load washer that came with the home I bought. I used it till I couldn't stand it anymore. I love the front-load machines - everything at eye level especially with the pedestal stands and I don't have to lean over to move clothes from the washer to the dryer. I really believe that front-load machines do a better job and use a lot less water. Win-Win for me.
5.0,"""Outstanding Product""","This is an outstanding product. We've only owned it for a couple of months so my review is based on this short time frame. It performs great, and is really efficient and much quieter than our old top load washer. The only suggestion that I would make is that rocking could be eliminated totally during high spin I'm guessing this is because of the pedestal that the machine sets on as we had the opportunity to use the machine without the pedestal and didn't notice rocking during high spin."

4.0,"""Nice but some limitations""","We replaced our old front load washer and overall this is nice.It washes well and is quiet. My concerns:1. Upon spin completion it should rotate back and fourth a few more times to release the items from the drum. Unfortunately it does not and I have to reach around to pull some items off the drum, or manually spin the drum to find them.2. The modifiers are limited. Our old front loader allowed unlimited temperature and spin speed settings. Certain cycles on this machine limit the options.These are all firmware issues that should be re-programmable.Otherwise a good machine.  I only gave three stars for value as I think the buy up price over white is a bit over the top. Maybe $100.00 would be reasonable. Not $200 +"
4.0,"""Front Load Washer""",The performance of this washer is very good. It is easy to operate and no problem with electrical components. I would recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
4.0,"""Good washer""",Everything is perfectly functional but the gasket around the door that is not draining water perfectly creating a bad smell unless you are drying it all the time.
5.0,"""Great Product. So many features that I love.""",This washer is the best washer I have owned. It washes heavy duty loads with ease. My family of 6 goes through 3 - 4 loads each day and this washer is up to the challenge. I love how quickly each cycle runs through. I love the steam cleaning option for delicate items and bedding.
5.0,"""Great Product""","Bought this washer after much research, since it was replacing the machine I bought 23 years ago. It's been great! Very easy to use since it came with clear instructions. Clothes look and feel great after washing!"
5.0,"""Impressed""","We are absolutely impressed by our new washer. It is amazing how little water is uses yet how much cleaner the clothes are vs. a standard top loading washer. I am very, very pleased so far!! Thank you Samsung for a great product!!"
5.0,"""Great friend for the dryer""",Definitely a great buy. I was hesitant with the price but it was well worth it. This with the dryer pair is amazing. Quiet and performs well.
5.0,"""HAS A GREAT FUTURE""",SO FUNCTIONAL WASHER ..EVEN THERE IS STEAM CLEANING.WHAT CAN YOU ASK MORE
4.0,"""Great washer, fast and silent""",This washer doesn't vibrate as others of the same kind. It has differents cycles depending on the type of load and it is fast.
5.0,"""This product is excellent!!""",This is my first time owning a front load washer and dryer. I am very pleased with both of them. I just wish I would of bought them sooner!!
5.0,"""Great Product""","I have only had this product for a few days, I am very satisfied with the quietness and very low to no vibration during washing cycle. I don't know at this point if the washer will have long lasting durability. It appears to be well made."
4.0,"""Much much better than my previous washer""","I find it does a much better job with all types of clothes. I like the quick feature for those times of need.When installing I had to remind installers of the steam ""package"". They almost didn't hook it up correctly. So might want to double check on that."
4.0,"""My first front loader""","I purchased this washer as my first front loader. I was surprised at how much longer it takes to wash the clothes than my old washer. Normal takes over an hour. And when I select to wash in Cold water, it takes 16 minutes more than if I washed in Warm water for the same Normal cycle. I can't find a reason why. The washer works well now but it leaked when I got it. A Samsung repairman came and verified that a service bulletin had been issued against my washer for this problem and he fixed it for free. This one also agitates so forcefully that it walks across my floor. I do have laminate flooring so it's easy for things to move across it. The repairman confirmed that most front loaders do that and that having a pedestal would help this a bit. I didn't buy one of those. The other thing that happened is that I shut the washer off mid-cycle. You have to turn it on by using the Power button before you hit Start. Both buttons are on the edge of the front so when I put my hand on the washer mid-cycle, I hit the Power button by accident and shut it off. It had only filled a little bit so not sure that it made that much difference. Overall I'm happy with it. It's just taken some getting used to."
5.0,"""Great dryer""","I've been impressed with the dryer - easy to load, looks nice, runs quiet and energy efficient."
5.0,"""So far so good""",My last washer lasted 11 years. So I went on the hunt for a new washer. There were so many out there I needed to narrow the feel. So I turned to the Internet. I asked for the top ten washers and Samsung was high on several list. I have several Samsung products and have had great service. When I saw the Samsung washer compared to the others I did not hesitate.
5.0,"""Great Washer""","I love the steam cycle, it improves the washing of my clothes. And I now have a self cleaningcycle, which my machine alerts me it's time to clean."
5.0,"""washer and dryer""",awesome product. easy to use. Would recommend to a friend
5.0,"""Samsung front washer""",We have had this washer for 2 months now and I really like how it has been working for us. We set it up ourselves and have not had any problems with it.
5.0,"""Great features""",We had to purchase this model after our previous Samsung stopped working after 12 years. Love the new design. Touch screen is so much nicer than previous turn dials. Washer cleans in less time.
5.0,"""Excellent washer!!""",We recently bought the Samsung washer and dryer and they are amazing!! It is incredible how clean and wonderful smelling the clothes are that we wash and dry. With a huge capacity on both we get our laundry done in half the time! I would reccommend these products to everyone!
5.0,"""This product is excellent!!""",This is my first time owning a front load washer and dryer. I am very pleased with both of them. I just wish I would of bought them sooner!!
5.0,"""This product is awesome""","I had a Samsung washer and it broke so instead of fixing it, I bought a new one. That should tell you what a good product it is to go right back to the same brand after you have one that breaks! I love the front loading washer as it is so easy for me to put clothes in and take them out. You have so many choices of short wash, steam, etc. I absolutely love the washer and would buy another as well. I also have the dryer. Great products."
5.0,"""So quiet""","This is my second Samsung front loading washer. It is so quiet when it runs, you only hear water running and nothing else. Great machine"
4.0,"""good value""",Really is a good value for all the feature that you will get a out of a front load. Checked the competitors and found Samsung had all the same or more features than all the rest of the brands. To bad that Samsung is getting all the bad and negatives about the products lately. I really enjoy this washer.
5.0,"""Makes a girl WANT to do Laundry!""","We got a great deal and free home delivery and installation. The technicians were wonderful taking care not to scratch my wood floors. The washer and dryer are quiet and the dryer keeps up with the washer!!! This is a first EVER in my life. When a load is complete the machine plays a cute little tune no more nasty ""HONK"" sound. We had to leave before the dryer was done, so when I got back (2 days later) my clothes that were left in the dryer were a bit wrinkled (but they were apparently dry) I ran a cycle to release the wrinkles and they were perfect! I LOVE this set. PLUS I got the pretty Merlot set!"
4.0,"""Great washer""","I like it because it's features, use less water and better spin."
4.0,"""Great Product""","This washer was a match to my dryer. The machine has a beautiful slick look. The features are very easy to use. The washer is very quiet during the wash and cycles and surprisingly quiet even during the spin cycle which makes me very happy. The clothes come out clean so it gets the job done. This product is made to use only liquid detergent so you are limited that way. If you have to have the washer stacked, you might need a step stool or ladder depending on your height. One other thing I noticed is that the inside of the washer stinks the next day or the next time I opened it. None the lass, It is a great product and I love it."
1.0,"""Washing machine terror""",My wife and I live alone and we were tricked into buying this junk. It only lasted 16 months from date of purchase and the matching dryer has been repaired twice in the same amount of time. This washer takes twice as long to cycle than any washer I have ever seen and only cleans if you wash one item of clothing at a time. Worthless waste of Money.
1.0,"""Worst appliance from Samsung""","I see all the high ratings on this product and have to wonder if they got something different than me. I have had nothing but issues and have gone through 3 washers and dryers. Had I not been a previous Samsung front load washer and dryer owner I would think this is a normal issue but unacceptable to me. The washer, although it is level, goes into a spin that will shake anything sitting on top of it onto the floor and rock all over your utility room. Lowe's has been good about exchanging it out until this last issue and I had to get a district manager involved. The problem being the second set had to be ordered putting me over 30 days of purchase but not in using it for 30 days because it was reported on delivery. The matching electric dryer pretty much the same issue with the vibration and the last one I got sounds like it has a tennis shoe in it when the drum rotates. I guess if I wore hearing aids I could take them out when doing my laundry and not have to listen to it all. Although the laundry comes clean and gets dry, I NEVER had any problem with my previous Samsung set until after 8 years when the drain filter went out. So I have upgraded to the top of the line which should be delivered Tuesday. Just praying there are no issues with these otherwise I may be screaming."
5.0,"""Samsung washer""",Love the color & the fact this machine is energy efficient and great on water.
5.0,"""Love the set!""","I don't know if I'd have paid full price for the dryer/washer I bought but at Lowes they always have appliances on sale and this purchase was indeed a deal! Love love love my new set and the color, I can't say enough!"
2.0,"""Love the washer, Lowes delivery not so much!""","Washer and dryer came yesterday.  Dryer is a steam dryer.  Unless I don't know anything, you need water to create steam.  Lowes delivery didn't hook up any water to the dryer, just plugged it in.  Ran the first load in the washer this morning and the thing shakes like you wouldn't believe.  You would think they would test this when installing.  Unit is too heavy for me to move myself to level with the stacking drawer below the washer.  Also noticed they didn't install all the parts on the washer, had to do it myself.  Now I have to wait another week for Lowes to come back out here and fix everything... VERY POOR service."
1.0,"""Extremely disappointed with Samsung""","Purchased this machine in 2011 to replace my 20 year old Kenmore. I also purchased the 4 yr protection plan.  After two weeks I began having issues with the machine so asked for a replacement which has lasted for 5 1/2 yrs.  I started finding torn pieces of the rubber seal in the washloads and found pieces of hard plastic in the drain filter... then started to notice burned rubber smell and eventually water would leak from under the machine. Called Samsung Customer service to trouble shoot; only the motor is warrantied for 10 years. However after having the authorized repairman out for $108 to diagnose the issue, I'm told the tub is out of circle and needs to be replaced. No one can tell me how this happens but apparently it's an issue with Samsung front loaders and will cost over $800 to replace the stainless tub and basket kit.  I was hoping to get better mileage on the machine that I spent so much on.  These are beautiful machines but not worth the money spent if you are expecting long term relationship! Needless to say, I won't be buying another Samsung washer or dryer.  Also according to Samsung this is not a common issue with these machines contrary to the repairman's findings."
5.0,"""Lifesaver""",My washer quit on a Sunday evening so off to Lowe's we went. Samsung items were on sale and I had always wanted a front loading machine. We purchased the pair and brought the washer home since I needed to ready items for a trip. My husband installed the washer and wallah.........I was in business. I love it and was amazed how the whites were whiter. Love the fact that you can use liquid or powder soap. Learning new things about it every day.

5.0,"""The front load washer performs well""","This is a terrific washing machine. I did a lot of research before purchasing it. Comments were positive and ratings were high for our price range. So I decided that this was the washing machine I wanted. I found a good deal at a local home improvement store. Once I started using the washing machine, I found it to provide a REALLY good clean for my family's clothes. Clothes smelled, looked and even felt really clean. It is also gentle on our clothes. I love the energy/water efficiency. Only one area for improvement and that is many of the set cycles are not significantly different from each other. One more thing.... the washer makes the sweetest music to signal the end of the cycle. Love that!!!"

Relatively easy to install, and while I wish that there were more capabilities with the app beyond checking errors, it isn't hard to set a timer to remind you to go out and check the clothes. The alarm isn't loud enough to hear from inside, when the machine is in the garage. Thus far, no problems. Hopefully it stays that way!"
4.0,"""Still new""","I have had this Washer for only a few weeks. So far it does an amazing job getting clothes clean. It seems to take longer than my traditional washer, but it depends on the options you choose. It is not on a pedestal and is fairly noisy with the laundry room door open. Sometimes there is water in the drawer that you put your soap in so you have to empty it before adding soap. Still really like it and am happy with my purchase."

Since my earlier washer stopped working I had a huge load of clothes which the in the new machine I was able to load in one go. The machine took very little detergent, and on heavy load ran for about 2 hours to give me the best cleaned clothes ever. This by far is the best and very easy to use, silent washing machine I have ever used."

4.0,"""So far so good!""",Used it for 5 loads and so far it's great. Capacity is larger than old machine. Front door has larger opening too for easier access. The clothes were a little more damp than old machine so set it to extra spin and that spun them drier without much extra time.The cycle time is also much less than our old machine which is great.
5.0,"""Good Product""",We purchased the Front Loading Washer and Dryer pair and are very pleased with these products!
5.0,"""So good I had to purchase another set!""","This is the second Samsung Washer and Dryer I have owned. I recently sold my house with all new Samsung appliances, and missed them so much I just recently purchased another set for where I live now. Not only do they look amazing, I love how these machines work and how easy they are to use. They wash your clothes very well and work quietly. The washer has many features to choose from. One of my favorite features is the steam feature in both the washer and dryer. As an added little bonus, I love the little music it plays when the cycle has ended. One thing I do miss from my original set, is the dryer rack (which seems to be no longer included). I had that in my last Samsung dryer and used it a lot for drying sweaters, sneakers, pretty much anything I didn't want tumbling too hard or getting damaged in the dryer. That's why I gave the features section 4 stars, otherwise it would of been a 5 star rating. Love these machines, I highly recommend them."

5.0,"""Our First Front Load Washer""",This machine is our very first front loading washer that comes with a lot of bells and whistles. For what we paid it's been worth it thus far.

5.0,"""Great wash time""",Love the washer. Love the features on it. Does a great job

So far so good. I have to mention again about the quietness of this washer it is truly amazing."
4.0,"""Better than I thought""","I have only had this washer for a few months, but it seems to be going well. I watched the first few loads go through sure that it would not get clean. There is little water usage so I wasn't sure that it could possibly get everything clean. I am not doing the full load that I had been doing with my top loader, but slowly building up to see what happens. We did have a horrible plastic smell in the first few loads that made the clothes unwearable because they smelled so bad. We tried bleach, soap, super hot cycles and nothing could get it out. I ended up using a Tide washer cleaner soap and that got it out. Its been about a month and it hasn't come back. So far so good!"

5.0,"""Great Performance""",This washer was a replacement for our old Maytag. After just a few uses we are wondering why didn't buy this sooner. The steam/sanitize features are a great addition that we didn't have previously. Compared to our old machine this washer is extremely quite. When the spin cycle on this machine is done the clothes are almost dry already so our dryer times are greatly reduced saving us more money there as well. Another nice feature is that it plays a short tune when it is done (about 10 seconds but can be disabled).

4.0,"""Good product""",This is a good washer except that it shakes quite a bit when it is starting to spin. I am not sure if this is normal but it is annoying. My other concern is that it is not available in a slightly smaller version at a similar price. It seems that all of the smaller units are much higher in price.
5.0,"""Our First Front Load Washer""",This machine is our very first front loading washer that comes with a lot of bells and whistles. For what we paid it's been worth it thus far. I've honestly never had a better washer but this is also the first washer we have had that is not a second hand washer.

Other than that, the capacity is amazing to reduce the number of loads and get laundry done quicker."

5.0,"""Best washer""","I have only had my washer for a few days. I am very impressed with the quietness. The size of the drum is amazing I can double almost triple the load of my previous large capacity washer. The clothes are so clean. There so many features, I especially love the steam which probably eliminate the need for bleach. I will definitely tell my friends and family on there next washer purchase to get a Samsung . So far so good. I have to mention again about the quietness of this washer it is truly amazing."
5.0,"""Excellent Washing Machine""","I've always wanted a front load washer and I love this washing machine. I can get all my sheets and towels in the same load, and everything comes out smelling clean and fresh. Cleaning the dispensers and gasket is easy. The only drawback is no dispenser for my laundry booster - I have to pour it directly into the basket and then add water. It's not a big deal, but a dispenser would be nice. All in all, I am really glad we bought this."

I wish to see that the washer could perform additionaly of the automated cycles a few more independent cycles by function or combination.

We had such a great experience buying these that we went back a few hours later and purchased a new refrigerator. Monique was excellent in helping with our purchases."
3.0,"""I want my money back""","Owned this and matching electric dryer for 6 mos now.  I hate them both equally.  As far as cleaning, they do as advertised.  The washer will not stay level, causing the spin cycle to sound more like a demolition derby.  I have to move the machine back to its rightful place after every 3rd load or so.  The door will not close unless it is shut ""just right"".  Once refused to ever buy anything Samsung again.  I should have stuck to my guns.  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra couple hundred for the LG equivalent. My old LG was night and day better than this set."
2.0,"""Worked fine for a few years""","I bought this model (in Merlot) at Lowes in Dec of 2010.  It worked fine for a few years though it did seem to have odd behaviors  at times.  The time would show some number of minutes and then a few minutes later it would show a higher number and then it would be done in considerably less time than either of the displayed minutes.  Fast forward to December 2016.  Washer showed 2 minutes left and about a minute later I was standing a few feet away loading the dishwasher when I heard a horrendous crashing sound that quite startled me and then it abrubtly  stopped.  I called a repairman and the problem (like so many other front loaders) was the bearing and too expensive to fix.  Cheaper to buy a new one.  I will not buy another Samsung even though doing a lot of washer research over the last week leads me to believe the brand really doesn't matter as the bearings seem to be an issue with many brands.  It seems miele might give you 15-20 years and speed queen 10-12 but I'm not sure they would be worth the cost.As an aside, I also have the sambsung merlot dryer (that was paired with this washer) and it's still going strong so hopefully it will give me a few more years."

1.0,"""Scratches""",I do not understand how our brand new washer and dryer scratch so easily. All We have is our laundry basket on the top and it has scratched the top of the machine. Ridiculous!
1.0,"""BAD CONSUMER SUPPORT  - DO NOT BUY""","In 2014, 3 years ago (Now March 2017) we moved into a new home and purchased a new Samsung Front loader clothes washer and dryer:  Top of the line at the time with both wifi connectivity and a touch screen interface. (Clothes washer is WF457ARG) While the products have a beautiful appearance and advanced functionality, we've consistently had some basic leaking issues over the three years.     The leaks have been small - an annoyance more than anything -- don't change the laundry with socks on because you'll have wet socks.     We've had Samsung out to try to fix the issue under warranty and then again after the warranty ended which we paid for ourselves.   We were told to pay more attention to the door seal to make sure the seal was free from debris and clean.     We've been diligent about cleaning the seal and following the pure cycle recommendations every 40 loads.       About 6 weeks ago the leaking started again.   It was visible from the door seal once again but this time producing more water and unclear if all the water was coming from the door seal.   The washer is on a pedestal so the drawer and drawer handle (indented and facing up) capture some of the water and the rest of the water puddles on  the linoleum floor.   I tried to tighten the door latch screws thinking that making the seal tighter would fix the leak.   The latch did wiggle in place but while the tightening decreased the wiggle it did not fix the issue.     My complaints are certainly about the washer - I understand that I maybe the statistic and just happen to have a troublesome product off the manufacturing line.   I get it but what I'm upset about is Samsung.    My issue is that Samsung, despite a record of repeated calls doesn't seem to really care about me as their consumer..   They just don't care about consumer satisfaction?  We've had consistent issues with this washer.    The company is riding high on so much consumer success that they seemingly just don't have to care?   They have top selling products in many segments -- TV, refrigerators and dishwashing machines, phones, clothes washers and dryers and so many more consumer product types.    Don't buy a Samsung clothes washer if you expect Samsung to stand behind the product.  And I would also say  don't buy a Samsung consumer product period.    They seemingly won't stand behind their brand - because they don't have to   because they have become so crazy successful over the last 15+ years."
1.0,"""NEVER buy SAMSUNG!!!""","NEVER buy electronics from Samsung!! Their products are expensive and break within the 1st year. What makes matters worse, is the customer service department when you try to have something repaired under warranty. They do not call back, they closed the tickets on my washer even though it was never fixed and then they change their story. The companies they subcontract the work to are even worse. I have been fighting them since January 9th and believe they are just trying to wait our my warranty. I have never been so disappointed in a company."
5.0,"""2 months wonderful""",unbelievable washing ability. each time the clothes are washed they are noticeably cleaner. Much quieter than expected.
4.0,"""Works Well so far""",The techs leveled the washer so well that you can hardly tell its washing.The only issues as of today is the door is a little flimsy when opening and closingAnd the detergent draw leaks a little and it is also flimsy. But again we have had and usedFor three weeks and no major problems besides the very tiny leaking draw.
1.0,"""Door broke after 18 mos""","We've never loved this washer, and now officially hate it.  Paid $720 for the appliance and the required cord from Lowe's. Door came with small shards of broken glass in the cracks of the plastic handle, which resulted in stitches for me in the first week.  After 18 mos, the door is broken.  It won't latch properly, so we can't start a wash cycle.  Haven't reached out to Samsung yet, but really dredge the prospect of dealing with getting it fixed.  It's either something broken with the latch or the hinge, since both are made of non-stilurdy plastic.Washes fine if the door closes, but you kind of need both."

4.0,"""Great Washer For The Price""","I have only had this washer for a week but we have already put it through its paces. The features are great for the purchase price. The steam option really does help get out stains, I put in a pair of jeans after doing a brake job on the car and it got everything out easily. However, this cycle did almost take two hours to complete. If you use the normal wash cycle, you should be fine in regards to wash cycle length. We also like the quick wash option which completes a small load in about 25 minutes. Sanitize and allergen cycle are great too; however, they take a super long time to complete (expect 2 hour times). The spin cycles are great and with the clothes coming out less damp, it's less time in the dryer. The amount of water per cycle has not been an issue for us like others have mentioned previously. Make sure to level and calibrate the machine before you use it. The calibration instructions are in the manual, not in the quick set up guide taped to the washer oddly.Time will tell if the machine holds up. We like the fact that there is a 10 year warranty on the direct drive motor but with these new washers having so many electrical components, there is a lot that can break. So far so good!"
1.0,"""Hate This Washer!!!""",I bought this washer a year ago and the main panel just started blinking. I called for warranty service and a month later my washer is still not fixed!!! The additional warranty does not work well with Samsung and I will not buy a major appliance again with Lowes!!
4.0,,"THIS IS SAME REVIEW I GAVE THE DRYERJust got this installed w/ the dryer washer (DV42H5200), stacked. So far, washing and drying are ood but there are a few things I hadn't considered and you probably should:(1) the ring (which is a little song) is NOT loud enough to hear outside of the laundry room and there's no adjustment feature; it's on or off, period. There IS an app for it that I haven't gotten yet so I'm hoping it will give me a notice when I'm elsewhere in the house. Don't know though.(2)) on the dryer, the timer feature has only 3 settings: 20, 40, or 60 minutes. I'm used to setting whatever time I want along with the temp. Now I'll have to play with only the temp since the times are fixed. Not happy about that. (Haven't done anything special with the washer yet.)(3) DO NOT STACK THIS W/D SET UNLESS YOU ARE 6'6""!!! I'm 5'7"" and need a fairly tall stool to see the controls! They were straight up on my previous W/D so they were easy to see. On these they're slanted back so you CAN'T see the top one! It's preposterous. Now we're going to have to reconfigure our small laundry room to try to un-stack them, and that's not going to be easy OR desirable .Why still 4 stars? Because the washing and drying are both (otherwise) very good, whereas the previous set was giving us problems. As for items 1-3 above, I wish I had realized these things before buying this set. Don't make the same mistake."
