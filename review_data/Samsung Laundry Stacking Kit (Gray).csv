3.0,"""Needs better quality control.""",The stacking kit that I bought did not come with directions in English. Could not any directions in English online. The screws that came in the kit did not fit in the back of the washer. I had to go buy smaller screws to fit in the washer. The kit does do what it suppose to and hold the dryer on the washer.
1.0,"""Open box to make sure no missing parts.""",Drive 20 miles in order to have the stack kit for delivery guys to be available to install washer and dryer.  Pick up box. Arrive home and the installers find that there is a missing bracket.  Sealed box with missing parts.  GIVE ME BREAK.  No installation and 30 minute wait on phone to talk to someone about next step.
2.0,"""Kit arrived with NO SCREWS in the package""","The kit is very effective in locking in stacking.     I paid to send it overnight FedEx and it took two days and then arrived without the screws included in the kit instructions and pictured, so I had to go to the local ACE hardware and get the right screws.     More delays and more money.    When I finally installed the stacking kit it worked very well, which is why I'm giving the product at 2 stars rating, 5 for the product and 1 for the kit/on line service agent.    Called Lowe's  and they did not offer any credit for the screws I bought, just an ""I'm sorry, it should have had the screws"".    They should have offered my a credit for having to go buy the screws at ACE.   I would not buy from Lowe's again because of the poor service when I called and not offering a credit."
5.0,"""Very useful""","Was pleased with the customer service I had via the phone. Would still like to have a Lowes built in Grants, New Mexico."
1.0,"""Clearance issues""","We could not stack our set using this set. The dryer seats several inches behind the back edge of the washer. This greatly reduces available clearance. There was only 1 1/2 inches of clearance behind the stacked set. Useless. We have an in-floor drain system setup in our laundry room, so the stacked set cannot be moved in any direction. We had to return it."
