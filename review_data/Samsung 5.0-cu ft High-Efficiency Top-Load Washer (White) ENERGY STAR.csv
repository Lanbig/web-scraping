4.0,"""Virgo2017""","Great washer!  Gets the job done!  A little deep because I am not tall but can handle it,"
5.0,"""Great Washer""",I just ordered the matching dryer.  I got my washer recently after reacting to the recall.  It washes just as good as the original. I am very happy with the washer and I am looking forward to getting the dryer.
5.0,"""Great washer""","I received my washer and dryer today. I have done 4 loads already and have no issues with anything. I love the no agitatir because it makes doing blankets and sheets a dream!  And it has a brilliant whites setting and maybe it is wishful thinking, but I swear the whites really are brighter!Pull the trigger and buy the set. You won't be disappointed."
1.0,"""No Wash Machine""","This machine does not wash clothes, period. First one made loud noise from day one. Left soap residue on clothes. Tried three different detergents, same result. Doesn't wash out deodorant, or the odor it's supposed to stop. Second machine same lack of washing ability, same noise started after two weeks. Maybe Samsung detuned these machines after the exploding machines recall?? Returned to store for different brand."
4.0,"""Love it!! But not for short people!""","I'M 5""3 and I had to buy a step stool just to reach the clothes on the bottom of the washer.  Its comical to watch my daughter 5""2 jump and grab the clothes.  For this reason I gave a 4."
3.0,"""Had to exchange unit.""",It made a lot of noise.  Sounded like the motor was grinding.  It is being replaced tomorrow.  I hope the replacement is better.
1.0,"""Disappointing""",I have had this machine for 3 years and it has been serviced twice. Even the technician admitted that this model has had recalls and issues.
2.0,"""Horrible""",We purchased this set in May of 2015. The washer has been making a horrible grinding noise for the last few months. When it spins it sounds like an airplane taking off. Had extra clips added because of a recall. Here it is August of 2017 and the whole thing needs replaced! Lowes bought out our warranty so they will send us the money we paid for it to go get a new one. I wont have a matching set anymore. The dryer also quit yesterday for the second time in 2 weeks. Just had a new thermostat put in it on July 15! Ridiculous. Will never buy another Samsung appliance.
1.0,"""The worse home purchase I ever made""","If I could give zero stars I would. The washer does not wash. Have owned for less then a week,I have done 6 loads. I followed all written directions, did as instructed to "" mix loads"" just did a load with one set queen size sheets, mixed with kitchen towels and hand-towels and a few socks. One towel came out complete dry, no not from spinning, it was DRY, it never got wet. Another came out with the same spots it went in with, and no it was not set in food stains.  The definition of to wash , is to clean with soap and water, this washer does not wash.DO NOT BUY this washer!"
3.0,"""Too deep-needs to come with grabber""",Who knew? I never thought about this when choosing this new top load washer. I have a difficult time reaching the bottom of the tub. Should have purchased the 4.5-but no - husband had to get the BIGGER one.  I'm going to have to buy a long handeled grabber. Other than that the machine works well.
1.0,"""Not happy""",Well bought it from Lowes which sales lady never told us it doesn't come with hoses so when Lowes delivered it they would not install the washer.   Bought hoses on way home and installed washer would not go into calibrate mode per instructions in manual even called customer service who walked me thru steps and it still would not go into calibrate mode.   Found a you tube video of process and it finally started calibrate mode but doesn't finish.  Lowes can fix the issue being it's less than 2 hours of use or I'll buy another brand
5.0,"""Samsung washing machine""","I purchased the Samsung washer because the price was right at the store. I did not realize the capacity until it was delivered. The features at the store caught my attention right away. The active wear, self-clean (yes!), and bedding, and the no agitator was something I really wanted among other features that were a plus. In addition, the price was low and affordable. Once the set up was finished, I washed two loads of my son's clothes in no time. I was impressed at the time it would have taken to wash with my old washer. The capacity helps wash clothes in no time, the sound is smooth. Simply put, I am happy with my first purchase of a Samsung washer."
5.0,"""Great washer""","I purchased this under the recall program for a previous 4.5 CU FT Samsung which I loved and worked perfectly. This 5 CU FT Samsung works great. No problems whatsoever. Delivered and installed by Lowes. It's relatively quiet although I have a door to my laundry room so not really an issue. The tub is deep so if you're short it'll be a reach to grab the socks off the bottom. I would recommend the 4.5 CU FT model in this case which could handle a king comforter without problems. I love all the features. No issues washing big loads of towels, sheets, bedding, etc. Everything seems to come out clean and fresh. I turned off all the sounds. The controls are very intuitive and easy to setup a load for washing. I would recommend this washer to friends."
5.0,"""product anti-vibration feature is nice!""",I had balance problems continually with a Whirlpool washer I owned prior to purchasing this Samsung machine. No problems with this Samsung. I also love the quiet operation of this machine. I would highly recommend this Samsung machine if you've had balance problems with washers in the past!
1.0,"""worst machine I ever bought""",delivered 5/10 worked till 7/27 when it broke. Samsung repair came 3 times each time with new parts. Last time they were going to replace all the wiring. I told them take it back. I went out and bought a ge.
3.0,"""My new washer""",I like my new Samsung but I need a hotline to ask some questions when using it. So far if I use normal cycle and more detergent my laundry comes clean. I washed a blanket on quick wash and didn't clean it. I wiped the stains out after washed. The deodorant doesn't come out of some of my husbands and sons shirts. So I will try the normal cycle for them . So a hot line would be nice. I called a 1800 number but it's fir repairs. I also heard knocking when it wasn't on high spin won't use that again.
1.0,"""Broke within 1.5 years of purchase....then broke again""","Within 1.5 years of purchasing this washer, it stopped working. Since it was over the 1 year manufacturer warranty, we had to deal with the extended warranty company. It took 4 different technicians to come to my home before this was fixed. First they showed up to diagnosis the issue and it was diagnosed incorrectly, then we got the wrong part (for a drain pump that wasn't even broken to begin with), and finally they figured out it was the control panel and we got that replace.....TWO months later....here we are and the washer is broken again. SAME ISSUE. But this time we got charged a diagnostic fee (which I don't understand since we told them EXACTLY what the problem was) and now we are waiting (3 weeks so far and counting....) for a technician to come and replace this part. I will never buy Samsung appliances again.  I am also writing a dryer review since that also broke too.... Not good quality. :("

5.0,"""Really nice, quiet washer""",I really like this washer. It has so many options for washing. When the cycle is completely finished it chimes a series of pretty chimes. I am glad I bought it and hope it lasts forever.
4.0,"""Beautiful appliances""","My new washer and dryer arrived today and I love the size, their appearance, and they can accommodate my king size spreads and quilts. I don't know how they are going to do over the long run but I am very pleased with my new purchase. Now I will see if they can last 15 years like my old ones"
