    "sentence = \"I bought this washer in February 2015. It's not getting heavy use - perhaps 2-3 loads per week. In April 2017 (26 months of use), the Heavy Duty cycle is unusable. The power cuts on and off (no display), it restarts randomly etc. After 5 hours of trying to finish a load that was supposed to last 1 1/2 hours, I finally gave up and pulled the clothes out. This happened with 3 different loads. The other cycles are still working, at least for now, but I won't be surprised if they have problems soon too. Of course, the warranty just expired. It's too much money to buy these to expect big repairs two years in.\"\n",

      "Great value for the price and capacity had nice reviews on the consumer reports site.\n",
      "We have had this washer a couple months now and are really enjoying it. I don't think we'll ever use all the features but there is a cycle for just about everything. In regards to some of the negative reviews I will say I think this might be a higher maintenance machine. I always leave the door open for several hours once I'm done with laundry as the machine is wet inside (I even wipe out the water with an old dish towel from around the rubber seal and detergent/bleach drawer). I think that solves any smell, mildew, etc issues. Also, I would just make sure to let the machine go at the highest spin level when its being installed to make sure its level. Its way easier to have the delivery guys fix it than do it yourself afterwards. Overall its a great washer and we really like it. Very happy with our purchase.\n",
      "This machine has a number of great feature unavailable on units we previously used, i.e., allergen, bedding ans sanitize, which heats the water and uses steam.\n",
      "Absolutely love the product! And really enjoy the cute music when it is finished.\n",
      "What a terrible washer. Has broken twice inside of 1 year. Samsung customer service is useless. They have been very difficult to deal with. I just called lowes and they where nice enough to take care of it. It took the lowes lady over an hour on the phone to arrange a date for them to take a look at 4 weeks later they came. Even the Samsung repair man said they are junk. He is very busy. Do not buy. If you did purchase keep the original receipt. It's not a matter of if it breaks it's a matter of when it breaks.\n",
      "The Samsung frontload washer is amazing. It is easy to use, my clothes are clean, the number of features and options suit any need, and it is pretty! I know some people who own front load washers and they complain that they take too long or they leave a smell or have issues with water. This washer has none of those issues and has been great from the start!\n",
      "Wow, I my clothing is coming out the very cleanest they have ever been. So easy to operate and very nice looking. Very little water used for a perfect wash every time. Love this new washer.\n",
      "Love it. It works great. Exceeds my expectations. So happy with my purchase.\n",
      "We love how quiet the washer is and the clothes are barely wet when the cycle is complete. I do love all of the cycle options. I have only had the machine a few days and am loving it. I find the display of remaining time very helpful. Very happy so far.\n",
      "I Have only been the proud owner of this matched set for about 2 weeks. I have never had a NEW  washer and dryer in my life. I did lots of research ( as much as I could) and finally \" bit the bullet\" and went to my local store only 55 miles away and looked and looked and ordered them. The young men who delivered and set up my stacking set was very personable and answered all of my silly questions. My clothes never have looked better and I am so happy with my decision. The red color just adds a lot of personality to my otherwise bland utility room. I'll let you know if I change my mind!!\n",
      "It is the first time that we have bought a Samsung washer. It has now been a couple of months, and it has been nothing but excellent. We like the large wash basin. We like the large door opening. We like the ease of use on the features. It is a very practical washer and has the ability to steam. The clothes are coming out clean as we had hoped. With this washer we do need to monthly clean out the debris filter in the front bottom of the unit as it will begin to smell if that waste water is left to sit too long.\n",
      "I love this washer cleans clothes very nice wouldn't go to any other brand!:)\n",
      "I was pleasantly surprised by this washer,having not usually liked front loaders. It's quiet and efficient.\n",
      "Awful washer has leaked water all over ny house nunerous times. Now is broken again wont ever complete a cycle will run all day long. Extended warranty trchnician is a joke been waiting 3 weeks for these people now they say they ordered the wrong part!! Hate this washer and its only been 2 and a half years.\n",
      "purchased this type of dryer 6 years ago and two of those years it was in storage. The drive mechanism (Y shape brackets seen in window above) corroded and failed. the motor bracket is $90 but the new tub is $500 and the drum is no longer made. this is a general problem with all Samsung washers.buyer beware\n",
      "My clothes always come out nice and clean and don't stick together that much\n",
      "Great Machine and fun and easy to use. Would recommend to anyone.\n",
      "I have owned 6 washers in my life. Each one was a different brand; every time I bought one I was hoping for a better product but instead all I got was a rewash of the junky ones that rip up your clothes and leave barely any scent from the detergent on them. With this washer; the fragrance lasts all day even though I have a highly sweat intensive job. No matter the grime I come home with I know my washer can get it out and leave my clothes feeling nearly new and smelling exactly how I want them to.\n",
      "Samsung makes a great washer that has a huge capacity and always gets the clothes nice and clean. It's really handy to be able to get all the kids clothes or all of the blankets in the unit.\n",
      "I looked at a lot of reviews before choosing this washing machine. I am happy with my choice. Two of my housemates use it at least a couple of times a week. It has handled a variety of kinds of loads. My third housemate who is blind has asked me to thank you for the sounds that he can turn on to accompany choosing the settings. Listening to the sounds makes the machine easy for him to use. When the machine is washing, it is much quieter than our old top loading machine.\n",
      "This is by far, hands down the best washing machine I have ever owned. Gets the clothes super clean with less detergent and less water. I love it!\n",
      "Other washer broke and had to buy a new one and this one here attracted my attention. I love how this washer is so musical in sounds rather than the old one I had that made a beep of a sort. It seems good so far as a washer, and I will probably update my review later when I have used it more. It comes with a steaming option too!!!\n",
      "We read the hundreds of reviews across the web on this unit before purchasing during a sale and we decided to take a chance because the sale prices were so good. We are so glad we did! We have had no issues with washing our King sized comforter or blankets: you just have to pay attention and choose the correct settings for every load to ensure the best outcome for your laundry. I love the short wash and delicate settings, and I sanitize our bath towels and shower curtain periodically. All in all we are VERY pleased. I also like that I can turn the sound off and on, but I've gotten really used to the happy sound that signals the end of the cycle!\n",
      "It does take very little amount of water. After having wash I hand wash to see amount of detergent it leaving into cloths! I found online similar complains from people and remedy for it. Its too weird that people have to reset settings at sensor level\n",
      "Best washer ever owned and nice designas well.Thanks Samsung\n",
      "This Samsung washer is a great design with high quality digital trackers. The color adds to the updated look in the laundry room. This washer saves water usage and lower our water bill. It runs quietly and is high efficiency.\n",
      "the features on the washer are amazing. steam wash, allergen settings and more. does a fantasticjob with removing dirt from clothes. plus I love the color we chose, Merlot.\n",
      "Not too sure if it's suppose to shake this much. Got it in and all leveled,. also ended up supporting the underside with wood across the front and back frame. It is up on the pedestal and so probably magnifies the shake a bit. Having it just up on the legs seemed a little to unsteady, and the two 2x4's in the front and back help. But man, before it gets up to speed during a spin cycle it just thumps and shakes like crazy. After 5 seconds it speeds up and mellows out. Wow does that thing spin fast. The off balance alert never comes on, so I figure it's just the nature of these washers. Oh, and this is such a heavy washer. Had to bring it to a second floor laundry room. I think it's filled with cement and reinforced with lead in back.\n",
      "This is the worse washer I ever brought! I had it for less than 3 months. Samsung customer service was horrible. They came out and replaced the motor, the wire harness and the men's sensor and the PCB. It takes forever to get them out for service. When they replaced the wire harness they said they would have to come out again and bring other one. Who brings a bad one out. It looked like they had drug it behind a car. Long story short, Samsung sucks as far as customer service. Lowes was great and took the washer off my hands and credited me towards a new washer. Great service from Lowes! Go with a Maytag, can't go wrong. Samsung is bad news!\n",
      "I was so excited to get a new washer. My old washer no matter how many times I cleaned it, it would leave steaks on my whites and darks! I'm so happy to have a washer that actually cleans my clothes as it should. The features are great as well and I can't wait to learn more as to what it can offer.\n",
      "stopped spinning and then locked the door and with my clothes in it!!! returning asap!\n",
      "This one replaced an older Samsung front load with a broken spider gear. This new one has many more features I really enjoy, and even cost less! Love the ability to steam sanitize and also spin without rinse for those wet pool towels. Haven't used the smart features yet.\n",
      "I was really impressed with how this washer worked and how easy it was to use.\n",
      "Great price for the quality. Washes clothes without damaging them, and doesn't use more water than necessary, which is awesome.\n",
      "The color is very attractive, the amount of clothes it holds is awesome, the app to tell me when its finished is handy, and it is especially great if you have lower back problems.\n",
      "I like it because it's features, use less water and better spin.\n",
      "Home delivered on 6/11/2017 and can't wait trying it on 6/12/2017. It looks nice as expected and take care of them carefully after each load. So far so good, will continue to try it and see how it really is.\n",
      "This washer has too many feature that one may not use often but using just the general setting is enough for me. I would love this even more if it wasn't so loud when the water comes in. You can hear the water run into the machine and it sounds like a fire hydrant so we try not to run it when others are sleeping.\n",
      "In the months we have had this washer, our whites have gone from dingy to bright.  The house doesn't shake when it spins and it is quiet.  We use Sanitize a lot because I am handicapped and don't always make it to the bathroom in time.  I have no idea about any other models or brands but that feature alone makes this washer worthwhile.  I'd buy another if this one dies and I highly recommend it to others.\n",
      "The washer is big and comfortable. I like it a lot.\n",
      "This machine washes clean, energy efficient, quiet, and easy to use.\n",
      "This is a very good Washer. We have had it over two years The balance is a bit noisy though!\n",
      "Been using my new Samsung front loading Washer and Dryer for a week now. I bought the units that have the Steam feature but are not the very top of the line ones. Both units are easy to use and quite in operation. I am very pleased with how clean the clothes come out. I am using the recommended He Turbo detergent which does seem to do a better job cleaning clothes. Initially I was worried that the steam and sanitizing modes might get the clothes too hot and damage them but so far those modes seem to work fine. The only negative for me so far is having to reach any clothes at the rear of the drum. I'm 70 yrs old so for most users this probably isn't a big problem. My college age son and daughter won't have any problem.\n",
      "I have had this washer for three weeks now and we have given it a solid trial. So far no complaints! Works well and is much quieter than my old one. Uses less water and detergent than the old one too. Easy to learn to use and has all the options you could want. I bought the grey and it looks amazing in my laundry room.\n",
      "This purchase was due to an Exchange Rebate. Upon making a decision to buy a new washer we had no doubt but to buy another Samsung Washer (all our appliances we own are Samsung brands). However, we decided on a front load washer this time. We were disappointed that we had to give up our top load washer, but so far it is working out even better than we thought. It washes just as good as our top load. The benefit that we did not realize is that it is definitely easier to get the wash out of the washer. So in the end, it was a blessing. The only thing that is difficult for someone who likes a matching set is that our Washer and Dryer do not match.\n",
      "This is a terrific washing machine. I did a lot of research before purchasing it. Comments were positive and ratings were high for our price range. So I decided that this was the washing machine I wanted. I found a good deal at a local home improvement store. Once I started using the washing machine, I found it to provide a REALLY good clean for my family's clothes. Clothes smelled, looked and even felt really clean. It is also gentle on our clothes. I love the energy/water efficiency. Only one area for improvement and that is many of the set cycles are not significantly different from each other. One more thing.... the washer makes the sweetest music to signal the end of the cycle. Love that!!!\n",
      "I absolutely love my new machine. My old washer was 20 years old, so I feel like I am actually up to date now.\n",
      "We bought our dryer in April,one month later the washer went.We are very happy to say that they were replaced by Samsung products.These are top of the line machines and out perform any thing else we've had.\n",
      "We bought this product on April 30 and a piece of rubber broke off on May 27.  We immediately called for repair and were told 2-3 days.  After 6 days I contacted them again and they said another 2-3 days.  It is currently June 5 they say this morning it will be June 19!  I have four children that change clothes often-this is completely unacceptable!\n",
      "i have never had a front loader before and wasnt sure i wanted one but bit the bullet ....love it...never go back again this samsung works great\n",
      "So quiet and yet powerful enough to clean even the heaviest bedding. I used the sanitize feature on my bed pillows and they look and smell like new. This equates to me, money saved on purchasing new pillows and bedding.The design is beautiful, I especially like the fact that my clothes don't come out wrinkled like my last machine did.Price is awesome as well.\n",
      "This product is amazing, the features are great, and I definitely recommend it to anybody looking for a washer!!\n",
      "I hope my review will help people avoid what I have gone through.  First of all I purchased a Samsung top load washer and barely a year after I purchased it it stopped spinning out.  Thankfully a recall was issued on the washer and I was able to return it and get a replacement.  However, there are two options....both options require your out of pocket to begin with.  Option 1 is to get any brand replacement model for up to $548...you make the purchase fill out the paperwork with receipt and they send a check in 5 - 6 weeks.  Option 2 is an incentive for Samsung loyalty and you make the purchase of a Samsung machine...still submit all paperwork, but you get up to $637 back.  Now I was not sure about Samsung, but I was willing to give it another try.  I mean I did have problems with what is now a recalled machine and they are trying to make good on it.  Even though I have to shell out the money first I will give it a go.  So yesterday I took delivery of my brand new Samsung front loader.  I was so excited to do laundry...I live way out in the middle of nowhere and my laundry was piling up for over a week waiting.  It was delivered, installed, rinse+spin cycle ran and calibrated...like the manual shows and all before the delivery team left.  I put in my first load...a load of towels.  5 minutes into the wash the machine starts flashing on the panel and playing music like it does when it starts or finishes.  I called Samsung and they had me unplug the machine for a reset.  Then restart it and told me if it happens again to call Lowe's because the machine was just delivered that day.  Okay so I start the wash over and it is putting in water and moving around some but not enough water to swish the cloths around but I know these are HE machines and I have faith.  Then I come back and there is an OE error for water level sensor.  What in the world.  I change the machine to drain+spin.  It drains and NEVER spins.  Just continuously trying to drain for HOURS.  I call Lowe's and they call me back today for the S/N.  In the process I chat with Samsung today.  They tell me to check the drain filter for debris...HELLO it is a brand new washer first load!!!  They say they will send a technician out.  Send a technician out for a brand new machine????  Thankfully Lowe's is going to switch it out.  However, I have to wait a week before they are back in my area again.  The contact at Lowe's assures me that they sell a lot of these machines and maybe I just got a 'lemon' so I am going to replace with the same model and cross my fingers that it actually works.  However, be warned.  Samsung is terrible at making washers and they do NOT care about the consumer or making it right.  If they did then they would want to replace the machine from the get-go.  I will be doing a quick wash before the installers leave on the exchange machine!!!!  Thank goodness Lowe's stands by the products they sell.\n",
      "great washer lots of different programs that take care of anything that needs washing easy to use\n",
      "But this and the dryer is a combo the dryer had problems in less than a year and the washer broke in less than 2 years would cost me more to fix it then it would be to buy a new one Samsungs have awful products my Samsung refrigerator broke also\n",
      "While the dryer that matches isnt anything special this washer is killer. Really like how clean it gets my whites.\n",
      "We had an LG washer/dryer set for 8 years and never one service call. We replaced just over one year ago with a Samsung washer/dryer set. We've had multiple issues, and have had three service calls within one year. Now the washer won't advance past a certain point on the wash cycle and off course we are two weeks past the one year warranty period. I will not be purchasing a Samsung washer and dryer again.\n",
      "I love this washer made a great buy thank you I will be buy my matching dryer next\n",
      "I love the special features of this washer, especially the \"Sanitize\" and \"Allergen\" features as I am continually washing my dog's bedding.\n",
      "This is the 2nd Samsung Front Load Steam Washer. It has more steam features including Allergen and Sanitize with even better performance. I am very satisfied with the product and highly recommend it.\n",
      "Just bought this unit and so far I love it. It's quiet, efficient and looks great in my laundry room. I look for ward to many years of good use from this set. Love the colors, too!\n",
      "I upgraded from a top load washer and I am in love with the front load feature. This washer has child locks (big since I have 2 toddlers), is quiet and does a great job of cleaning and keeping my clothes fresh!\n",
      "Purchased this dryer to replace a worn out appliance, and was extremely pleased with the performance, when paired with a matching dryer. drying time was much faster than my previous dryer and also gentler on my clothes.\n",
      "I'm loving my washer so far. It really gets the job done!\n",
      "Amazing washer. Coupled with the dryer makes washing clothes exciting again.\n",
      "I am using this product for more than 2 months now and very impressed with the ease of use and performance. Strongly recommended - excellent product at a great price point.\n",
      "Love the color & the fact this machine is energy efficient and great on water.\n",
      "This washer has a larger tub for more cloths. The user friendly cycles make it easy to start with just the push of a button. Operation is so quiet sometime I check to see if machine is operating. Loving everything about this product!\n",
      "After 2 years running, my Samsung Front Loading Washer was broken. Now when I start it, it cannot finish the assigned program and stop at somewhere. A technician of Lowes said the motherboard was broken, it need to be replaced to fix the problem.The washer is really not reliable, not recommended.\n",
      "Bought this washer in March of this year. I love it, it's a great investment.\n",
      "We just bought the set of these and they seem to work great so far. We have only had them a couple of days. They are a huge improvement over what we had before which came with our house.\n",
      "My wife and I live alone and we were tricked into buying this junk. It only lasted 16 months from date of purchase and the matching dryer has been repaired twice in the same amount of time. This washer takes twice as long to cycle than any washer I have ever seen and only cleans if you wash one item of clothing at a time. Worthless waste of Money.\n",
      "We purchased this washer, it has been the loudest washing machine ever owned.  Less than one year later it quit.  Samsung certified repair comes out multiple times to fix it, then determines it is not repairable.  We are now 77 days with out a washing machine and still trying oto get our money back from Samsung.  Never again will Samsung get a dime from me.\n",
      "This washer has quiet performance, fast washing, and easy to operate\n",
      "Samsung is a new brand for me. The machine performs wonderfully and has many nice features!\n",
      "Wow !!! Just love everything about this washer.. Laundry all done thanks to the size of this washer.\n",
      "We bought our Samsung front loading washer from Lowes about 5.5yrs ago.  I'll be generous and give it 2 stars because up until a few months ago, I liked the washer.   Here's 3 issues to consider before buying...  1. It's smelly: Up until now, I loved the washer...it was nice looking, ran smoothly but I do have to say it's almost ALWAYS had a mildewy smell.  I'd say it started smelling about a year or two in.  I read a couple years back that this is a typical issue with front loaders in general.  I think it was something to do with the way the barrel sits.  I mean, I run the clean cycle (\"pure cycle\") I wipe down the rubber molding, clean the filter, leave the door open to air it out...nothing really seems to get rid of the smell completely.    2. Pieces break: About 3 months ago, the plastic door latch just shattered to pieces.  I couldn't run a cycle because the door wouldn't lock.  I looked on youtube for repair advice and luckily it looked like something I could fix.  So, I called Samsung, ordered the part which took 5-7 business days to arrive, watched youtube and fixed it myself.  It wasn't too bad a fix (about $50) but I did have to peel the rubber away from the door and get into the machine to remove the existing latch and replace the new one.  3. Doesn't last/expensive to fix: About 2 weeks ago, our washer started to make a LOUD rumbling sound toward the end of the spin cycle.  It rocks and rolls and makes a whole bunch of noise that we can hear throughout our 3,300 sq. ft house (similar to an airplane landing) with the laundry room door closed.  I googled the issue to see if I could repair it myself but according to reviews, it was mostly likely the bearings were worn and I'd basically have to take apart the whole washers to fix it.  I called two appliance repair services (one recommended by a friend and one I found on google), explained the noise and both of them said that it wouldn't be worth the service fee for them to come out because it's 98% likely that the bearings are shot and it's easily an $800-$900+ repair.  I called Samsung and of course they said that there isn't recall on my washer and that  this isn't a common problem (even though if you google \"Samsung loud noise during spin cycle\" you'll see, there are plenty of people with the same issue).  They gave me a couple things to try: clean out the filter and take off the water hoses and clean the little screen inside each connection.  Did that and ran a couple loads.  No improvement so now Samsung recommends I have it looked at.  The dilemma were faced with is spend $100s of dollars and TRY to fix it or look into a buying a new washer.  If we have to get a new washer, I'm going to file an official complaint and we'll probably go with a top loader, and definitely not a Samsung.  I believe a major appliance should last more than 5 years.\n",
      "There is no review to accompany this rating.\n",
      "All features are enough and the quality of wash is superb. I love the color and it looks awesome on the new machine room.\n",
      "This has been an absolutely trouble free washer for a year now. No smell, no unbalanced loads, nothing, just clean clothes.\n",
      "I love the look of my washer and dryer. It also works great!It's up there with my high standards of appliances.\n",
      "I am looking forward to using my new Samsung washer and dryer, I have only used them a few times and their performance was adequate. I was specially attracted to the platinum color and curved faced of the models.\n",
      "I love how quite it is. It has all the features I wanted and more.\n",
      "After looking and reading many reviews on several different brands of washers, finally decided on this Samsung. We had a high efficiency washer before, but this one takes that a couple of steps higher. The machine is quite, does not walk, is quite adapt at figuring out load weight and adjusting the spin cycle. You should know that using he quick wash cycle, the machine does NOT weigh the load.  This is important because if you're going to wash something like towels or jeans in a quick cycle the machine in all likelihood will vibrate and as a result will walk some.  Which brings me a glaring issue found in the instruction manual. The manual states that when you are going to wash a load using the \"normal cycle\" you open the door of the washer, press the power button, load the washer, add detergent and any other products such as bleach etc., close the door and then press start.  If you follow those directions the washer WILL NOT weigh the load and it will result in the washer vibrating during the spin cycle.  When getting ready to wash a load, regardless of what it is, DO NOT POWER ON THE WASHER WHILE THE DOOR IS OPEN.  Load the machine, add the detergent, close the door and then press the power button followed by any changes in the wash cycle you wish to make and then press the start button.  In the normal cycle you will see the drum rotate a number of times while the display panel will show a series of rotating lines.  This means that the machine is weighing the load and will then be able to automatically adjust itself for the correct spin to keep the machine from vibrating.  This is a great washer. It's smart and will do a terrific job.One other note.  When you use the \"self clean\" cycle, be aware that this is a FOUR HOUR process. Yeah, I know, crazy amount of time.  So it would be best to use it when you are going to bed.\n",
      "I love the features on my washer, just turn dial, and it sets the time, and so quite.\n",
      "THIS PRODUCT HAS GREAT FEATURES AND IS A GREAT COLOR TOO\n",
      "My mother has always had the cheapest washer and dryer she could get and they were horrible. Not any more she feel in love with this Washer and I don't blame her. Its amazing and does a fantastic job. So many awesome features. My only worry is when the day comes that the digital stuff messes up. but until then We couldn't be happier\n",
      "The product looks good and works well. I suggest getting the pedestal. It will save your back.\n",
      "Just got my new machine and it works great. I've purchased other Samsung products in the past and have always been pleased\n",
      "love the smart options and the time on the digital readout is real time not \"laundry time\".\n",
      "I just got this washer because my GE top load washer just too noisy and was slowly on its way out. I have only had the washer for a few days now , but love how quiet it is. It can handle everything from jeans to bed covers with ease. I haven't had the chance to use the allergen or steam options ,but I will shortly.\n",
      "I purchased this washer November 16.  The washer leaks. I am calling Samsung service for the third time in 6 months. The Samsung companion dryer wades everything into a ball. It takes for ever and constant attention to dry your wash. This washer has ruined my laundry room floor.\n",
      "We purchased our Samsung washer and dryer on mid apr 2016. Delivery and installation was on time. Products work very good, just as expected. Some condensation accumulates on the plastic of the front door, so we leave the door open after finishing washing to let it evaporate.\n",
      "We had another 'excellent' brand washer that did NOT live up to it's excellence at all. After over 20 years of trusting that brand we decided to try Samsung whereas we have had no problems with all the other Samsung products we own. This washer is extremely quiet! It sings a song when it has finished the cycle which is much nicer than an obnoxious buzzer. Our clothes are very clean. The instructions for use are simple. My electronically challenged husband was able to figure it out without difficulties. He loves the washer too. Hoping this one lasts many years as it is very nice and a great addition to the house.\n",
      "This is the best front load washer I've own. Great features. Performs above my expectations.\n",
      "We have now had our washer for a week and what a difference it makes! All of our clothes are smelling more fresh than ever before. I love that I am able to customize loads and it will even save it to memory! Great buy, great value!\n",
      "Wonderful washing machine.. it washed my clothes very well. It's beautiful to look at. Very technically? advanced . I love it!\n",
      "Great FeaturesCleans soooooo wellQuietUser friendly Beautiful to look at\n",
      "Pre-ordered washer and dryer pair to have delivered two days after our move into our new home. The washer and dryer were delivered and installed they gentlemen that installed it started it on a quick wash to \"set up\" the machine. The machine's 26 minute quick wash stopped with 18 minutes remaining and will stay that way until it is turned off. Thinking it was a fluke, we restarted the machine and it stopped working at the same exact time. The machine will not spin out what so ever. Rinse + spin will soak and toss the clothes around until it is time to spin and then stops all together. So unfortunately we called Samsung for help. They told us to calibrate the machine this should take 1 to 3 minutes.... the machine will attempt to calibrate to no avail but doesn't  succeed.  So day 1, only a few hours into ownership of this oversized, overpriced sharp looking paperweight, yielded 3 phone calls to Samsung and 2 calls to Lowes. No one will send a technician out to address the problem, they offered replacement of the machine, ETA 75-90 days from now..... Living in Rural NH driving 30 minutes away to a laundry mat is not an option... This overall experience has left one heck of a sour taste. Should have stayed with the small family owned businesses I typically support and this whole run around would have been easily diverted.\n",
      "I love this washer. I .especially like the sanitize and allergen cycles. It's also gentle on my clothes and is quiet when its running.\n",
      "I'm 54 and have been doing laundry since I was 9.  This is the WORST washing machine I've ever seen.  We bought it for our vacation home, as we have a Kenmore front load in our primary home.  But this thing is JUNK, on medium or high spin, it is so noisy and bounces around the room. We tried a carpet, didn't help, I'm loading it back in the truck and returning it today!\n",
      "This turns out to be the best machine I ever owned. Love, love , love the steam feature most of all.\n",
      "This is my first time owning a front load washer and dryer. I am very pleased with both of them. I just wish I would of bought them sooner!!\n",
      "Has all the features I use with out being complicated Great value for the features offered. Very quiet. Love the lighted panel\n",
      "This washer is our family's first purchase of a front-loading machine. So far, we are pleased with the purchase. We have 2 high school sons who are in a variety of sports, so we have lots of laundry to manage. This machine is really quiet, and seems to get the job done efficiently. The longer wash time was a bit alarming at first, but since the machine holds more, it really doesn't take any longer than washing and drying 2 loads in the previous machines...in fact, probably less time!  I have heard other people comment over the past few years that they do not believe their front-load machine washes as thoroughly as a top-loader, but we have had great results with this machine so far!\n",
      "I LOVE THE FEATURES OF THIS PRODUCT. ALTHOUGH I HAVE RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT I AM VERY PLEASED WITH ALL ASPECTS OF WASHING AND THE DIFFERENT SETTINGS AND FEATURES.\n",
      "Very fresh looking I love my new washer and dryer!\n",
      "Very easy to use. Washes my clothes very well and doesn't leave them soaked when it's time to throw them in the dryer.\n",
      "This has a beautiful design seems to be easy to use, I love the color. The price point is very comparable to other models on market.\n",
      "their and old saying the NAME GOES ON BEFORE THE QUALITY GOES IN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE.\n",
      "This washer works great, steam cleans lots of stains out of clothes. A little noisy but very stable. I really enjoy the tone when the load is finished.\n",
      "Love this washer! Feels like I stepped into 5 years into the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "Bought this machine only a year after we bought another top loading machine. We were very unhappy with the top load. This machine gets our clothes very clean and the come out smelling fresh and not wrinkled.\n",
      "For what we paid for this machine, it's really great. My only complaint is the door isn't able to be switched from left-swinging to right-swinging. So we have to navigate clothes around the door when moving clothes from washer to dryer. Not a huge deal, but the dryer comes with this option, would hope the washer would, too.\n",
      "I just purchased my new washer and I already love it. It is quick and gets the clothes clean. It is also quiet and was very easy to install.\n",
      "This washer is an excellent investment. It is quiet, attractive, advanced and a welcomed addition to any home.\n",
      "This Samsung washer is an excellent unit. It is extremely quite and reliable. I have model 42H5200AW and it offers a sanitize, allergen, and steam cycles that are amazing. I would recommend this model to any friend or family member. Thumbs up to Samsung for this one!\n",
      "This thing is fast and easy to use. It's our first front load washer and I really wish I'd picked one up a long time ago. It's very much like the dryer we bought in that you can configure a lot of options when you wash clothes but again we have a simple 2 button process to wash. Awesome appliance.\n",
      "Between the three washer and dryer sets I looked at the dryer to this set allowed to to reach in and remove things that had gotten into the trap as some of the things my daughter and husband put in their pockets occasionally get by me. Which as you may know will keep it from fitting back down all the way and things with straps will get caught, twist and then rip or tear. This is the reason I chose this set.\n",
      "SO FUNCTIONAL WASHER ..EVEN THERE IS STEAM CLEANING.WHAT CAN YOU ASK MORE\n",
      "Very easy to use. Does a great job. Clothes come out almost dry.\n",
      "I love all of the features,. The best feature is the steam and the sanitize features. also a very quiet unit.\n",
      "overall this is an amazing washing machine. very quiet, quick, and efficient. Simple to use. We did have an issue; during the rinse/spin cycle the washer would start vibrating loudly. Did all troubleshooting from the manual and from samsung over the course of a month. Samsung ended up refunding us our money and we bought the exact same washer, hoping this one does not have the same issue.\n",
      "I bought this washer in February 2015. It's not getting heavy use - perhaps 2-3 loads per week. In April 2017 (26 months of use), the Heavy Duty cycle is unusable. The power cuts on and off (no display), it restarts randomly etc. After 5 hours of trying to finish a load that was supposed to last 1 1/2 hours, I finally gave up and pulled the clothes out. This happened with 3 different loads. The other cycles are still working, at least for now, but I won't be surprised if they have problems soon too. Of course, the warranty just expired. It's too much money to buy these to expect big repairs two years in.\n",
      "good product at a good price as is many Samsung products\n",
      "As a family with 4 young kids and two dogs, we have alot of laundry. Dirty does not describe what kids can do to clothes! This washing machine does an amazing job getting out the grass stains, food stains and anything else that comes along. Love it\n",
      "Purchased this machine in 2011 to replace my 20 year old Kenmore. I also purchased the 4 yr protection plan.  After two weeks I began having issues with the machine so asked for a replacement which has lasted for 5 1/2 yrs.  I started finding torn pieces of the rubber seal in the washloads and found pieces of hard plastic in the drain filter... then started to notice burned rubber smell and eventually water would leak from under the machine. Called Samsung Customer service to trouble shoot; only the motor is warrantied for 10 years. However after having the authorized repairman out for $108 to diagnose the issue, I'm told the tub is out of circle and needs to be replaced. No one can tell me how this happens but apparently it's an issue with Samsung front loaders and will cost over $800 to replace the stainless tub and basket kit.  I was hoping to get better mileage on the machine that I spent so much on.  These are beautiful machines but not worth the money spent if you are expecting long term relationship! Needless to say, I won't be buying another Samsung washer or dryer.  Also according to Samsung this is not a common issue with these machines contrary to the repairman's findings.\n",
      "My wife loves this machine!! It's quite,. It makes our clothes look bright, and smell great. The steam function lifts stains without soaking. It's AWESOME!!!\n",
      "I love this washer. There are so many cycle options to choose from, which makes cleaning all my different clothing items a breeze. I've had no problems with it so far, it's balanced well, not noisy at all, and I LOVE the little jingle it plays at the end of a cycle. It makes doing laundry actually fun! After a cycle, I leave the door open and wipe it down, as well as the detergent tray to help prevent any mold growth as is common on front loading washers. I enjoy the steam cycles, but find I don't use them as often as I thought I would. Mostly just for when I do the sanitize cycle for towels or sheets. But having young children, that cycle is a MUST HAVE for me! Any sickness, bed wetting, or whatever else comes along gets washed right away with that sanitize cycle! I love it. The display is wonderful. Very easy to read and find what you want. The \"buttons\" on the display aren't real push-in buttons, just touch, and I know that bothers some people, but I'm fine with it. It's actually better to me that they don't wear out fast.  Overall, an excellent washer and does a great job for my needs. I would definitely recommend this washer to a friend!\n",
      "Up until today I would have given this washer 5 stars.  We are less than 21 months into it and it has stopped working.  Our old Maytag lasted 20 years!  The washer has great features, but is VERY poorly made.  After researching on you tube, I see there are lots of people having the same issues!  Samsung customer service is a joke!  Spend your money on something on a brand known to last, not the one known to fail !!\n",
      "My wife has been wanting this washing machine for a long time. it has been a dream come true!\n",
      "This washer is amazing I love doing all my laundry\n",
      "Have only had this washer for a month or so. Gets clothes really clean. Good so far!\n",
      "I received both the washer and dryer as a housewarming gift when I purchased my first new home. I love that they are easily stackable since I have limited space to put them. I also love the setting features on them and the musical alarm that plays when they are done!!\n",
      "My Wife and I bought this washer based on two things, the value and the reviews. We were not disappointed. Everything about this purchase was great. Starting with the phone to make sure I was all set here at my home for the delivery. It made it simple and no surprises. The washer it's self is fantastic. It's quiet and cleans clothes efficiently. I couldn't believe how well it has worked so far. If you are on the fence about this washing machine, I would say go for it. You won't be disappointed!\n",
      "There is no review to accompany this rating.\n",
      "In 2014, 3 years ago (Now March 2017) we moved into a new home and purchased a new Samsung Front loader clothes washer and dryer:  Top of the line at the time with both wifi connectivity and a touch screen interface. (Clothes washer is WF457ARG) While the products have a beautiful appearance and advanced functionality, we've consistently had some basic leaking issues over the three years.     The leaks have been small - an annoyance more than anything -- don't change the laundry with socks on because you'll have wet socks.     We've had Samsung out to try to fix the issue under warranty and then again after the warranty ended which we paid for ourselves.   We were told to pay more attention to the door seal to make sure the seal was free from debris and clean.     We've been diligent about cleaning the seal and following the pure cycle recommendations every 40 loads.       About 6 weeks ago the leaking started again.   It was visible from the door seal once again but this time producing more water and unclear if all the water was coming from the door seal.   The washer is on a pedestal so the drawer and drawer handle (indented and facing up) capture some of the water and the rest of the water puddles on  the linoleum floor.   I tried to tighten the door latch screws thinking that making the seal tighter would fix the leak.   The latch did wiggle in place but while the tightening decreased the wiggle it did not fix the issue.     My complaints are certainly about the washer - I understand that I maybe the statistic and just happen to have a troublesome product off the manufacturing line.   I get it",
      " but what I'm upset about is Samsung.    My issue is that Samsung, despite a record of repeated calls doesn't seem to really care about me as their consumer",
      "..   They just don't care about consumer satisfaction?  We've had consistent issues with this washer.    The company is riding high on so much consumer success that they seemingly just don't have to care?   They have top selling products in many segments -- TV, refrigerators and dishwashing machines, phones, clothes washers and dryers and so many more consumer product types.    Don't buy a Samsung clothes washer if you expect Samsung to stand behind the product.  And I would also say  don't buy a Samsung consumer product period.    They seemingly won't stand behind their brand - because they don't have to",
      "   because they have become so crazy successful over the last 15+ years.\n",
      "Gets the job done and doesn't take all day! The large capacity of this washer allows for a great quick wash. Everything's come out clean and fresh!!! Love Love Love it!! Custom built my pedestals and they fit like a charm!\n",
      "Just received my new washer I love the way it works and looks\n",
      "updated my washer the old one was 14 years old. this washer is like a car with the modern features.\n",
      "First washer I have bought in a very long time. Love the technology in it and very easy to use.\n",
      "I love everything about this product. Saved on my water bill from the efficiency of it. Love all the options.\n",
      "This washer really spins the close dry and is also a fun washer to use, love the tunes Samsung,\n",
      "THE WASHER IS VERY GOOD. EASY TO HANDLE AND THE DESIGN IS VERY NICE.THE CLOTHS WASHES VERY NICE AND SAVES LOTS OF DETERGENT AS WELL.\n",
      "This is my second Samsung front loading washer. It is so quiet when it runs, you only hear water running and nothing else. Great machine\n",
      "I'm in love with this washer. Super quiet, and stylish. So far it has handled everything I threw in it with ease, and I am rough on my washers. I throw in horse blankets and everything, plus kid stains and I work outdoors, so it has even handled messy grimy clothes handily.\n",
      "Works like a gem. I love it. I like the wash & spin selections. Clothes come out with right amount of dampness that doesn't take forever to dry.\n",
      "The only thing I miss from my prior set (stayed with the ex) is the hand wash option.\n",
      "This is a good washer except that it shakes quite a bit when it is starting to spin. I am not sure if this is normal but it is annoying. My other concern is that it is not available in a slightly smaller version at a similar price. It seems that all of the smaller units are much higher in price.\n",
      "Just made the purchase a month ago and delivered 2 weeks ago. So far it has washed excellent and it was easy to learn how to use. I have only used the normal and steam setting.\n",
      "Having had an older Whirlpool Duet, I was hesitant to buy another front loader because the old washer had been a problem from the minute we bought it. I have had my Samsung for about 4 months and I am in love with it. The only thing I miss is the Whites cycle, although the steam cycle is similar.\n",
      "Quick and efficient. It does a great job and is very quiet.\n",
      "Easy to install, and easy to operate. Cleaned the clothes perfectly! So far, the best washer I have ever owned!\n",
      "It's quiet, works well, haven't had it that long but I like it. Don't forget to clean it to keep the smell away.\n",
      "Love the washer. Love the features on it. Does a great job\n",
      "I actually bought a competitor's top-load washer and dryer and exactly 30 days later I returned them both and bought the Samsung Front-Loader and matching dryer. I honestly look forward to doing the wash now. My clothes smell fresh and clean. It takes less than half the time now to complete my family of 4's laundry. They are a beautiful set that sparkled up my laundry room.\n",
      "Just replaced a samsung washer we had for 10 years. We loved it so much we had to have another samsung washer.\n",
      "The washer itself is very sensitive. Im unsure if its due to the sensors or what but mine is not even 1yr old and I've had more issues with actually competing a full cycle without having to restart it due to an error code on the led screen.\n",
      "I am overall satisfied with this purchase!! My clothes come out clean and smelling fresher than any washer I have ever owned!! Time efficient and it doesn't take a lot of detergent to wash clothes! Looking forward to purchasing the matching dryer in the coming months.\n",
      "With the advent of high efficiency washers and the elimination of the agitator on top load washers, front load is the only way to go.The tumbling action accomplishes what the agitator would have done.Front load washers with no agitators have been used in Europe for a very long time with success.\n",
      "Works wonderfully. Easy to use. Very durable and great design.\n",
      "just purchased; larger than expected, washes quietly, will write more later. Great value for the price.\n",
      "Have washed about 10 loads so far. Good cleaning power and very quiet.\n",
      "Easy to use, quiet. Excellent performance! Exceeded expectations.\n",
      "I love the tones this plays at the end of the wash. Just a little happy feature to make everyday chores enjoyable.\n",
      "This is the first front loader I have bought and it amazing! Great features, cleans great, and is QUIET!\n",
      "Not only does this 'look good', but it is extremely quiet and efficient! Everything about the washer, so far, has been very pleasing! My only two thoughts of improvement would be that the music letting you know the load has completed has only one setting. It would be nice if you could change the volume. The unit does sit fairly low, a couple of inches higher would have made reaching in much easier, but I guess they prefer to make extra money selling a pedestal.\n",
      "Have only done a few loads as it was just delivered yesterday. Super quiet. Seems to do a good job of cleaning. As others have mentioned, the cycles seem a bit long but I just use the quick wash cycle.\n",
      "Appliance is very easy to use, quiet, efficient and looks very pretty.\n",
      "Great Washer and sleek look, Love Samsung products\n",
      "I bought this washer on September 8th on Lowes.com. It was delivered to my local store for delivery/installation to me, which occurred within the week. It has worked well (it replaced a similar model I had for almost 6 years...that should have told me something right there). The settings cover everything I need, and it has good capacity; that's why I reordered the Samsung. Well, on March 18th, midcycle, it just stopped. My wet towels are now locked in there. In fact, I can't even access the serial number needed by the technician because the sticker is located inside the door. Now it will be 7-10 days for ordering of parts. Lowe's mentioned a loaner in that event during our call the other day, but that's only for extended-warranty people (not me), even though it's still under Samsung warranty. Laundromat time? Nit before warning others that these Samsung washers have a life span of under 6 years...or 6 months...depending on your luck. I'll never, ever buy another one.\n",
      "We replaced our old and broken washer with this unit. We are very happy with it. it is a lot quieter than our previous one and is very easy to use. it cleans the clothes and gives a lot of options. The self clean and drain at the bottom is also an added feature that other machines do not. Overall very happy with our choice so far.\n",
      "Once I got the washer installed it was awesome. We had trouble with the big box store we bought it from because of the stacking kit. The delivery company would not stack it because the stacking kit was sent to us, not the delivery company. This is not the machine's fault and the Washer is awesome. I like the settings and that the wash time is pretty accurate. The music it plays is a lovely bonus.\n",
      "Since we got this cannot complain. Plus they are super quiet.\n",
      "Very quite easy to use and the pedestals are fabulous.\n",
      "It is very hard to retrieve serial number and product model number once in place. It would be beneficial if Samsung would include a second sticker with this information in bigger print and in a place more accessible, maybe on the side of unit. I already had it in place and had to use a mirror to retrieve the info to register the product online.\n",
      "Easy to assemble and use with standard features and no complaints other than at times when the washer is spinning the load it gets a little too loud and the vibration tends to move our machine around and out of position, however, I think it could easily be address when we figure out how to level it out. Overall, the product is wonderful.\n",
      "I love this washer - great cycles to choose from, very quiet, and low water use. You really do not need much soap either, so you are saving money across the board. The \"Eco-Warm\" cycle is a plus too to minimize your costs. Plus it looks good! The only drawback I see is that there is no pre-wash soap cycle.\n",
      "We're absolutely happy with this Washer ! It looks great & WORKS GREAT !\n",
      "Great units, with a couple of concerns if you stack them, and/or you are tight on space.  I really like this washing machine (and dryer combo).  The functions are great, many options, does everything I want and more, and you feel like you are using a fancy unit, to be sure.  I have not found any quality cuts yet, after 2 weeks of use.  I believe that Samsun will be a brand to set standards in the future, the effort is obvious that they put in on these units. 5-stars if they sit on a floor side-by-side.There are a couple of basic problems though.  Both are only around stacking the units.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND buying these units if you will be stacking them, but if you must stack a washer/dryer, below are the major things to weigh, before you buy these.  #1, the kit that you must use to stack/attach the washer/dryer, mounts the dryer on top of course, with about a 2\" RECESS backwards.  The clip \"bends\" far backwards, and there seems to only be 1 option.  I have a TIGHT washer/dryer space, it was a very big deal to install these units.  You will NOT be able to stack these units with less than 39\" of clearance, in order to close your closet door.  And that is only if you find the FLAT dryer exhaust vent.  Fully honest, below is 37.5 inches from the wall, and I had to do some hack-SAWING on the flange that comes out of the rectangle-vent pipe, and also SHAVE quite a bit out of a 4-inch spot on my wooden closet door.  These were last minute decisions, and when the door is SHUT you cannot tell that I butchered my closet door.The 2nd major thing is that an average woman height cannot see the controls on the dryer, that is IF you stack the units.  Step-stool required.  I measured 77.75 inches total, when stacked.  I took a picture from a height of a person that is about 5-feet 4 inches. See for yourself.  I am almost 5-11, and the top of my head comes to the top of the dryer glass-circle.I guess that the bottom line is, that I am greatly enjoying the washer-dryer.  We spent quite a bit more than our modest budget on these, so I confess that we feel like it is worth the step-stool hassle to use fancy units like these.  It may be difficult to read displays on EVERY dryer on the market when stacked.  Just saying.\n",
      "Cleans great, is very quite and cut drying time in half by spinning them so dry.\n",
      "We have had this washer for 2 months now and I really like how it has been working for us. We set it up ourselves and have not had any problems with it.\n",
      "I have loved this washer so far! Multiple settings make it easier to wash your clothes specifically the way you want them. I have no complaints.\n",
      "This washer goes above and beyond my expectations. It is very user friendly and read the manual. Great long term investment. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a washing machine.\n",
      "You must drain the reservoir to remove moisture and keep away mold.\n",
      "Clothes seem to be very clean and nearly dry when completing their cycle. What more can you ask for?\n",
      "IF YOU NEED TO STACK ANY OF THESE SAMSUNG WASHER AND DRYERS THESE ARE HORRIBLY DESIGNED INSTRUMENT PANELS!  Seems most of samsung models have the tilted panels that you CANNOT see when they are stacked unless you are 7 feet tall (no exaggeration my son is 6'5\") because cannot see the panel with the angle unless you are on a stool!  Customer service told me to unstack them to repair the problem when the ONLY reason I purchased was for stacking !\n",
      "Great product...Love the color and works great. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family.\n",
      "My wife loves the new washer. One it is Red (Merlot). It is very quiet! Has numerous settings only thing negative is that the pedestal for this would make it easier to load or unload.Very nice unit!\n",
      "This is one very nice washer. Probably will never use more than 25% of the features, but nice to know they are there. Please ensure you read the manual to ensure the calibration is run and how to utilize the cleaning steps for the filter in case you ever need it. Only 1 week of use, but so far very impressed as you can see from the ratings.\n",
      "Things i like about the washer and dryer: you can stack them or separate them. They dont take up a lot of space but holds a large a mount of clothes.Featuers i like: bedding, steaming, self clean, soil level. Basicly the options it give you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "First I was a little worry by the size, but when I push the start button after the setups, there was no noise, no vibration, it was amazing!. it saves me time to the Laundry, I'm very happy with this buy, I use a little liquid soap, it uses the necessary water. I recommend this also to use in an apartment.\n",
      "Just got the washer a couple of days ago after last one went bad. Love the time delay feature. Washes clothes very well. Very little vibration on spin. Very easy to use and intuitive.\n",
      "Love this new front loader. All the features are wonderfull. I have small bed wetters and the sanatize feature is great to have\n",
      "Excellent product that seems much better than our previous Samsung washer\n",
      "i've just been delivered my washer today and have used it and so far this washer is one of the best I have seen yet I luv this new washer and would purchase another in the future...    thanks so much this great washer KJHARRIS\n",
      "It is very easy to use, it cleans my clothes very well, and isn't noisy.\n",
      "the store was good and the price was good and people that broth them out was very nice and i like my wash and dry\n",
      "Just purchased this washer, and it works fantastic. The machine is so quiet I can barely hear it running. The notification tones at the end of the cycle are enough to get my attention so I don't have to constantly check if my clothes are done or not.\n",
      "I LOVE IT!!! IT IS VERY EASY FOR EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY TO USE\n",
      "Just got my new washer installed today after 15 year old washing machine gave out. Love the ability to program my own wash style in and keep it as a setting. Much quieter than previous old top load washer.\n",
      "I have just purchased this washer, but so far the features are great! I am excited about the sanitize and steam option for getting a deeper clean. The washer was easy to set up and we also purchased a pedestal, which was easy to mount. Very happy with the value and performance so far!\n",
      "No smell!  To those of you that right bad reviews about smell coming from the washer, if you would  READ YOUR OWNERS MANUAL, it's stated to \"leave the door open\" because of the seal.\n",
      "Clean design and functionality. We had to replace an older Samsung washer and this model was the best one available in our price range. Quiet operation. Cleans well.\n",
      "WE LIVE ON A FARM, THERE ARE DAYS YOU GET MANURE ON YOUR CLOTHING. THIS MACHINE HAS TAKEN IT ALL OUT, MOSTLY ON NORMAL LOAD, HAVE ONLY RAN ONE HEAVY DUTY LOAD AND WAS IMPRESSED.\n",
      "Spin cycle never ends, just keeps adding time.  The 30 minute cycle to over 2 hours to finish.  When the spin cycle gets to a high speed the washer really vibrates and the spinning shuts down. I think this is a safety feature - unfortunately it keeps trying over and over and never ends.  Clothes come out soaking wet. Looks like a common problem - just do a Google search.\n",
      "LOVE IT!! Best dryer I've ever had!! Love front load washer/dryer!!\n",
      "Used it for 5 loads and so far it's great. Capacity is larger than old machine. Front door has larger opening too for easier access. The clothes were a little more damp than old machine so set it to extra spin and that spun them drier without much extra time.The cycle time is also much less than our old machine which is great.\n",
      "Great Washer,good price! It's a washer so it's supposed to clean clothes so it does!\n",
      "We wanted a quiet washer to run in the evening after the kids are in bed. This washer is quiet and does not wake the kids. In addition, the time estimate per load is accurate, so we know when the check if it is done.\n",
      "I have had this washer for less than 2 years. Normal use for a single adult with nothing heavy in it. 2 to 3 loads a week. Now the main chamber bearing is going out and getting worse by the use. It is so loud you can not talk in the laundry room. My LG washer lasted 4 years I was using it then sold it with the house. 2 years later they are still using it with no issues. Samsung had a recall on the top load for bearing failure but the front load is doing the same thing without a peep from them except it is out of warranty and you will have to pay to have it diagnosed. So much for keeping all the same brand appliances. I wont buy another Samsung product after this. Tomorrow it will be cheaper to replace it with a new one than get someone to fix it.\n",
      "We had to wait for the washer to arrive. It took three weeks because they were on back order. We set up the washer on a pedestal because of not wanting to bend over. Great feature, however, the chemical dispenser is now quite high for my wife who has issues with her shoulders. Would like to have had a simple sheet recommending what selections to choose for certain items. Some of the features do not allow you to change the settings, which I am not totally satisfied. We have had some trouble with the washer wanting to \"walk\" on us. We did the correct calibration in the beginning. We will find a way to clear it up. The actual washing of clothes had been very good. So we find the performance of the machine to be an excellent feature.\n",
      "Just like it's dryer counterpart it works great, is quiet and has loads of useful features. Highly satisfied. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I purchased this washer on 2/5 and received it on 2/9/17. I have done numerous loads of wash and everything came out clean and the machine functioned perfectly.\n",
      "This washer works very well. It is efficient on water usage which is nice. The only thing is that the door has started locking, I believe we inadvertently turned child lock on so have to read the manual to fix that. Otherwise, it fits a large load. I can do an entire hamper in two loads, which is nice. It also plays music when it is finished which is great. These are larger then we expected, so it was a little surprise and taller then they appeared in the store. Too high to put a counter on top, but would be great to put cabinets above.\n",
      "I bought it for my wife. She loves the steam feature.\n",
      "I've had my Samsung 7 years and almost 2 months. The bearings has gone out and will cost about 1,000.00 to fix. Sorry I can buy a new one for around  $800.00. Can't fought the machine it's done a great job from what i'm hearing is the machines today last about 5 to 7 years. DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THEY USE TOO.To many plastic parts. Guess i'll be washing machine hunting.  Oh by the way if you'll drain the hose on the front of your machine let it air till the next wash day it'll never smell 7 years and never had that problem as I always do this.\n",
      "after 2 years this thing is so noisy and traveling all over and supposedly needs new drum. We have warranty so off to buy another. Have no idea what to get. It definitely will not be a Samsung.\n",
      "I love my new washer!!!!! Not only (can't believe I'm saying this) does it really look nice it's quiet, has awesome features, can hold a ton, and it truly cleans. I never really understood why everyone would smell their laundry in the commercials, but I get it now. Clothes smell clean, and really are, especially with all the specific settings. We have a house full of kids, dogs, cats and that means constant laundry. The sanitize and steam settings allow me to be confident that my laundry is guarenteed clean. Would recommend and have already.\n",
      "We have had this washer for less than a month. It has only been used about 12 times. Today, the Quick Wash setting quit working and locked up the machine with wet clothes in standing water. I was able to to switch to Rinse and Spin only to recover the clothes. NOT IMPRESSED. BTW, just returned a high dollar Samsung refrigerator that never worked out of the box. REALLY NOT IMPRESSED!!!!\n",
      "Easy to use, lots of great features and gets the clothes clean on the quick wash cycle!\n",
      "Within less than three weeks with this product I received error code 5E. As instructed, I cleaned the display filter and reinstalled. During the next wash cycle water leaked from the filter and the door on to the floor. Its noted that water was also observed on the floor after initial installation, but I did not notice the reason then. After receiving error code 5E again, I cleaned the door seals and attempted to unscrew the debris filter again. However, this time the filter cap did not unscrew and is now permanently stuck. The unit is now unserviceable without major disassembly. This is poor design, leading to poor performance, leading to poor maintainability.\n",
      "It has a hard time balancing loads is loud and shakes.  20 days in the Samsung repair man that looked at it said it had balancing issue but nothing he can do to fix it(just keep adding more items mid cycle...don't think so) and it is probably just a design flaw. Said I could try to exchange it but new one may have same issue (it did).  Returned the unit hoping it was just a defective one (Lowes has best 30 day return policy with no questions). Unfortunately new one has the same issues.  It vibrates excessively with the rubber door molding shaking as it tries to balance and get up to speed.  It makes noise like it is about to fall apart.  Sits on the same part of the cycle for 5 minutes or more as it can't balance. So a 114 minute load takes 15-20 minutes longer.  Do not buy.\n",
      "We bought this pair after our VERY VERY old washer/dryer set \"died\". We bought the set in white because they are in the basement and we don't really care what color we purchased. I also opted to not spend the extra money on the pedestals because the price for each pedestal was ridiculous. I built my own perfect pedestal from 3/4 Birch ply, 2x4 frame and trim and baseboard molding; all for less than the price of one pedestal.  The washer and dryer function great! So far, I have not noticed an issue with the common water/mold/mildew on the front load rubber washer door ring. The basin drains very well and I leave the door ajar once I'm done washing everything.  There are plenty of wash and dry cycle options to choose from (possibly too many), but I'm not complaining. I'm sure I'll eventually use every one of them. The wash times are relatively quick, compared to my old machines and the machines themselves are quiet; though the dryer is a bit noisier than the washer, but not significantly so.  I read the manual and saw this \"Smart Care App\" feature, unfortunately our model only uses this to diagnose the error codes. I was hoping I would be able to get the \"Load complete\", \"load dry\" notification, but alas, I suppose I'll have to use my watch.  I love all of my Samsung appliances (laundry and kitchen and TV's). I will continue to buy them.\n",
      "This is my third Front Loader washer and this is my favorite. It remembers the last load settings and automatically shuts off when it is done.\n",
      "Brand new washing machine, cannot give a review at this time. Had previous washer for eleven years. Hope this one works as well.\n",
      "The washer works great and does an amazing job cleaning our clothes.\n",
      "I BOUGHT THIS WASHER AFTER MY TOP LOADING WASHER WAS RECALLED. I FOUND THIS MACHINE EASIER TO USE AND CLEANED MY CLOTHES WELL. I HAD DIFFICULTY WITH MY TOP LOADING MACHINE BECAUSE OF THE DEEP REACHING I HAD TO DO TO GET MY CLOTHES OUT AFTER THE WASH WAS DONE. MY NEW MACHINE HAD ADDED FEATURES WHICH I FIND HELPFUL AND PRACTICAL.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT ANY RESERVATION.\n",
      "We have had the washer and dryer combo for about 2 months. We have used the steam option on both products and were very impressed with the results. Like how quiet the operate and the options for being energy efficient. The units look really nice in our new utility room ; really adds to the modern look of the house.\n",
      "Large capacity. Quiet. Easy to use. Like the steam feature.\n",
      "unbelievable washing ability. each time the clothes are washed they are noticeably cleaner. Much quieter than expected.\n",
      "Works great. Cleans great, large calacrity.Plenty of options.\n",
      "error \"4e\" has shown several times..i am giving 4 starts before it broke before one year of use. I wish to see that the washer could perform additionaly of the automated cycles a few more independent cycles by function or combination. (i.e wash and rinse or only rinse), rinse and spin, etc/ when it broke those cycles would have been extremely useful. I am delighthed with this applianace. however they could exel and improve the automation/functions.\n",
      "Loving this washer! There are so many great features and it's so easy to use!\n",
      "When deciding to replace my old laundry appliances, I did a lot of reading. I was aware that some people had mold/mildew/etc. issues with front loaders but thought that a simple wiping of the rubber ring after washer would resolve that problem. I care for my appliances so assumed I'd have no problems. No longer so sure.After the wash cycle is completed and the clothes removed, I wipe down the fairly wet glass/plastic door and as well as the rubber seal around it. I also wipe and leave open the compartment for the detergent and fabric softener, which are also wet. At this point I feel that the machine is far more high maintenance than the top loader it replaced. However, I wouldn't even mind doing the extra drying steps if I felt as though it would be effective but I don't. I think the machine has a stale or otherwise funky smell nonetheless. I've only had this washer for a little over week because I had to wait a month past the scheduled delivery date to get it (likely the fault of the retailer but double-check availability when ordering). Still, I've done lots of laundry in that time and fear the smell will get worse, not better. I have just done pretty basic washes and still need to read more in the manual. My impression is that there are a plethora of options but it will take some reading and time to be able to fully take advantage of all the settings.I did not purchase an extended warranty at the time of sale because I generally believe that when you pay a lot of money for a high quality product you should be able to depend on it. With respect to this washer however, I would strongly recommend getting the warranty if you decide to buy it.\n",
      "Used a Miele front loading washer for 20 years. Smooth as silk. Had to upgrade to a larger maching, and, hence, bought this Samsung one. Brand new, run for 2-3 weeks. Experimented with all kinds of loads - no difference. At the highest speed, the machine smoothens out, but spinning up, to get to the programmed speed, it has a vibration intensity of 20 on a 1-10 Richter Scale. Machine is mounted on a matching Samsung pedestal. Samsung service personnel changed the four shock absorbers, which didn't make any difference. The vibration is so severe that the matching Samsung dryer, located next to it, also starts vibrating. And, the machine walks on a tiled floor, and moves completely out of its location until it is stopped by the adjoining dryer or cabinet on the other side. Pushing the machine back into its location, after each and every use, is hard, since it is heavy. And, without side access, it becomes even harder. The service representatives on the phone are polite, but there seems to be no record of previous calls. Have to repeat the entire history, calmly answer all their checklist questions over and over again, till finally they assign a service person. Don't know which is more frustrating - Samsung service or their appliance. The features of the machine are otherwise very good, and clothes get washed and dried well. With so much vibration, I am quite confident that the life of this product is going to be very short. And, by Murphy's Law, it will fail catastrophically after the 1-year warranty.\n",
      "I have had great results with this product. I have been very satisfied with my frontloading machine.\n",
      "I've had a chance to use this washer several times already and I just love it. I've been using the quick wash, which takes much less time and really cleans the clothes. Quiet washer, which is a plus to the one I had before.\n",
      "I was told the washer was ready to use, but it smell like oils or some sort of strong smell of some sorts. Maybe it's just the brand new smell, but very strong.\n",
      "BAD IN THE LONG RUN & HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! When I purchased this washer, I read the great reviews and was happy with my purchase, at first.  Then our washer slowly got louder, until it sounded like an airplane was taking off from my laundry room.  After multiple calls (note me calling them and them not returning calls) we had a service person out and said we needed a new drum.  Samsung agreed with this, until we argued & proved that they needed to pay for no and then the washer didn't need this anymore but only a repair.  The repair fixed things for a while  about 8 months later the washer started to get louder and louder.  And now we are back at an airplane taking off in our house.  We placed multiple calls and emails to Samsung, being promised a return call the next day, the return call happened once and resolved nothing but another promised return call.  We have called them each day for 5 days with no resolve.  Today we were told that they would send a service company out the next day to repair.  The service company called my husband to set up a visit (1 to 2 weeks out, not the next day) but said they wouldn't schedule unless we provided a credit card number as Samsung noted in the file we would be paying for it and they wouldn't schedule until this note was updated by Samsung.  They also recommended we get the promises made by Samsung service in writing since they don't back their promises.  We called Samsung to request this and were told no being provided the notes from our file, that it was confidential.  Then when we asked to be transferred to a supervisor or someone else, we were told no.  We then called back and spoke to another customer service rep who also told us no on transferring and that we would have to wait for a call back.  So now we are waiting for Samsung, yet again.\n",
      "I was used to using the old wash board and octagon soap as well as the old school top loaders. Wow, I tell you my new Samsung front loader washes twice as much loads as my older tip loader and more cleaner than my old wash board. This was the best decision I had made in a long time.\n",
      "Washing machines aren't glamorous so this is going to be a pretty boring review. It cleans well that's very quiet. Only problem I have with it is some of that Cycles take too long.\n",
      "Hahah i did my first load and it did a little song after it was done. while cute that was quickly disabled however every other feature on the washer is great!\n",
      "I work in a professional environment, so we are looking forward to using this time and time again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I purchased this washer machine a few months ago based on the reviews and I absolutely love it. My clothes always come out fresh and clean and the appearance of this platinum washer is high end. I am happy over all.\n",
      "great quality and savings on detergent and utilities\n",
      "This washing machine is very quiet. It does a great job cleaning. It spins clothes so well that it reduces drying time. I love it!\n",
      "Just purchased a new top loader and dryer from Samsung 3 months before we put our home up for sale. Had to leave the new set with the sale of the home. Turned around and purchased a new steam washer and steam dryer. Love the pair. Clothes come out clean and almost dry from the wash cycle. Love the signal at the end.\n",
      "This is my second Samsung front loader (I wore the other one out). I love the updated features and the lack of noise.\n",
      "I received my washer as a Christmas gift so have not had it very long but am so happy with it. I washed my dogs bed cover and it came out cleaner than it has been in forever, it looks brand new. Dirt and stains that had remained after numerous washes with other washers were gone after one use. It is amazing.\n",
      "As a first time buyer of a samsung appliance, I am super pleased with my purchase so far and I hope it stays that way!\n",
      "I purchased my Samsung washer about 10 months ago and it has been nothing short of a nightmare.  My first washer never worked because the seal on the door was faulty.  Lowes had to send someone out to make sure I knew how to operate the washer before taking it back. So after 2 weeks they finally decided to give me a new washer.  But Samsung special orders like this model can take up to a month to deliver. Another bad attribute about Samsung.  I got my second washer 25 days later.  Fast forward 3 months and the washer goes out again.  I bought the maintenance plan from Lowes and that could be the worst purchase I have ever made.  It has no benefit to the consumer AT ALL! There are a lot of loopholes that work in their favor and Lowes doesn't really care.  I made a big fuss to the store manager and he didn't really do anything.  All he said was that it was within the 1 year and it is up to Samsung.  Luckily, I did get the washer fixed and we were back to normal for now.  Now, here we today.  About 4 weeks ago, I got the patented \"4E\" message on the display.  So I call in again and they say that it needs a valve part to be replaced.  Appliance Advantage said they get a lot of calls on this, and to order the part it will take 3-5 days.  So time passes, they show up and say they do not move or unstuck the washer/dryer. I was at work while my fiancé stayed home.  Instead of us rescheduling, she goes to get a few neighbors who just by chance were home.  And the lowes service advantage just stood there while 3 women move a washer. Very classy Lowes!!! They install the piece and it did not fix the problem.  So they said they needed to order another part. And that will take 3-5 days. So we go through all the above again 5 days later.  Install a new computer board and the repairman shorts out the washer and now it won't turn on at all. So then they say they have to order it AGAIN! But now I am questioning the competency of the repairman because he didn't even put the hoses back in the right places.So I call Lowes customer service, they tell me all the repairman have to do is to give me some paperwork saying it needs to be replaced.  So then I call Advantage appliance and they say no that's not the case, Samsung tells them what to do next.  So then I call Samsung and they say that is not true, they just need the repairman to call them and say it needs to be replaced.  In short, the maintenance people have zero interest in doing what's best for the customer.  Their job is to turn in as many tickets to Samsung so they can submit invoices.  Almost done, hang in there with me.  So after the 5th time, I go to Lowes store for a 4th time yesterday. While standing inside,  I call lowes corporate office and gripe to some poor soul where I demand the district manager's name and contact info.  While I am talking to them, the same assistant manager who didn't help me before is standing there with deer in headlights stare. I tell him that I am calling the district manager and I am going to tell him about my experience and the lack of customer service I have received.  I also told him that the Advantage appliance phone number was disconnected and I simply had enough! It was only then did the manager say he would take back my Samsung setup including the dryer and replace it with a Whirlpool that has the least amount of service calls.  In short, do not buy any Samsung appliance for long delivery times. Do not purchase the maintenance plan, it does you no good unless you have a spare washer laying around or you enjoy taking your laundry to the neighbors for weeks on end.  Be ready for Lowes not to help you unless you threaten to call the district manager.\n",
      "A decent washer. It has a great size handiling a good size load. Plenty of wash options, more than my wife and I, and most people would use. Not to loud except on the spin cycle. On the spin cycle it seems intermittent, start spinning then stopping, only to start again. The door sticks a little and even my wife thinks she is going to break it when pulling it open. Would love it to stay on delicates when powering up since it is our most common preference. All in all not to shabby of a washer for the price. Oh yeah and beautiful color!\n",
      "We got a great deal on this and the matching dryer at Sears over the holidays, and you just can't match the quality for the price! Relatively easy to install, and while I wish that there were more capabilities with the app beyond checking errors, it isn't hard to set a timer to remind you to go out and check the clothes. The alarm isn't loud enough to hear from inside, when the machine is in the garage. Thus far, no problems. Hopefully it stays that way!\n",
      "New washer was delivered yesterday. Did 2 loads of laundry last night. Very quiet. Clothes came out looking great. Love it so far\n",
      "NEVER buy electronics from Samsung!! Their products are expensive and break within the 1st year. What makes matters worse, is the customer service department when you try to have something repaired under warranty. They do not call back, they closed the tickets on my washer even though it was never fixed and then they change their story. The companies they subcontract the work to are even worse. I have been fighting them since January 9th and believe they are just trying to wait our my warranty. I have never been so disappointed in a company.\n",
      "Best washer I ever bought! Just make sure it level. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "I love how gentle front loaders are on our clothes.The cycle selections are great - different models offer different options.This one had enough for our downsizing family.Going by past reviews we've read, we look forward to this being a great investment.Only reason for not rating it higher at this time is I've only had it for a couple of weeks.So far so good.\n",
      "We just got this set and have used it once. It does what it is supposed to!\n",
      "So far I am enjoying using my Samsung front loader washing machine. It is easy to use and two tablespoons of liquid he washing detergent is all that is needed for a load of laundry. There are many nice features that come with the machine that makes it a good buy.\n",
      "Outside of my first unit having a bad seal/gasket, ultimately flooding my laundry room, the replacement unit has been pretty good.\n",
      "When i first saw it, i immediately fell in love with it. You can wash many clothes and it's easy to use.\n",
      "I bought my Samsung Front load washer from Lowes in 2012.  I will have had for 5 years in April this year.  My experience with this washer has been unpleasant.  It pops error codes constantly, and you are always have to start the wash over.  Had the repair service out while it was under warranty multiple times and it had multiple problems that were fixed.  The seal was bad.  the soap tray was bad.  The processor control card was bad.  It just had everything wrong and broke down once a year.  Well, it is out of warranty, and the Drum cracked.  This is an inferior product, beware!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "I have only had my washer a few days, but my clothes are coming out clean and fresh!\n",
      "just bought washer a couple of weeks ago works great and hope it does for many years to come\n",
      "We purchased seven years ago. Moved it twice short disiances. Operated great till this week. Banging and smoke ! Repair person stated it needed new drum and mount, $650 with labor. I think seven years is to short of a life span for a washer. Three person household for four years then two person for the remaining three. So I am looking for another brand.\n",
      "one of the features i love the most of this product is it's quietness. The way it cleans my clothes and leaves them very clean etc..\n",
      "Machine was working well for almost a year.  It then stopped working and we had to spend almost $400 to get fixed.  It was outside of its warranty period as well.\n",
      "We've owned this washer 4 months and this morning I could not change the selector dial to use the \"delicate\" cycle. The previous wash was \"normal\" with \"hot\" chosen for water temperature. I could not change it from \"normal\" to \"delicate.\" I tried unplugging the machine and letting it sit for a few minutes before plugging it in and that didn't help. I wound up washing cloths on the \"normal\" setting and after the wash was finished, it allowed me to change the setting to anything I wanted. I downloaded the Smart Care app to see if I could connect with the machine to solve the problem (this machine is supposed to be blue tooth capatible) but my phone could not find the washing machine. The phone indicated there might be a problem with the internet or internet security setting, I don't have a problem with any of the other 10 internet-connected devices in the house.\n",
      "So far I love the machine except for the need to buy a stand which is true of all front loaders. The only think there is no setting for a small or medium load.\n",
      "The washer preforms and looks great. Just what I was looking for.\n",
      "This Samsung washer has all the bells whistles .All you need to do is load the machine,and push a few buttons.The machine does all the rest.\n",
      "This is a beautiful machine with great features. I even love the music it plays at the end of a wash.\n",
      "I have used this washing machine for two months now and has at least gone through 100 loads of laundry. So far so good. It is quiet and very cost efficient. Too many features to list but they all seem to work well for each mode of wash. I fully recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a new washer.\n",
      "Samsung front load washer. I just bought it , I did a lot of shopping around. I love this new washer and dryer.\n",
      "Just had this white gloved delivered. Two loads run and all is well. Straight forward to run, quite when running. It's a keeper.\n",
      "This washer is amazing! The options are incredible and they fit all our needs! If you are considering this product I highly recommend it!\n",
      "Have only had a week, but no issues so far.  Takes a little longer to wash than my old top loader but appears to get the clothes much cleaner.Several things i have read/heard about these.After the cycle, leave the door cracked to let the machine dry out.  Also clean the inner part of the seal as debris will build up.If using pods versus liquid or powder, place the pods in the bottom of the drum versus the trays. Also make sure if you use fabric softener that it is well mixed and not lumpy or it won't feed through the tray.\n",
      "Definitely a great buy. I was hesitant with the price but it was well worth it. This with the dryer pair is amazing. Quiet and performs well.\n",
      "The washer in general is a good washer however, there is a design flaw with the front rubber gasket. Over time it tears causing leakage in the washer. We have had it repaired now 2 times in less than one year. For this reason, I would not purchase another one or recommend this product.\n",
      "Very efficient washer. Runs very quietly and really does a great job on our clothes.\n",
      "This machine is our very first front loading washer that comes with a lot of bells and whistles. For what we paid it's been worth it thus far. I've honestly never had a better washer but this is also the first washer we have had that is not a second hand washer.\n",
      "has all the options including steam cleaning. you can customize options in certain modes to cater to specific needs. easy to understand and operate.\n",
      "Love Love Love this machine. Clothes are super clean with lots of options for even the most delicate of clothes!\n",
      "Great washer machine just wish it was much easier to put the bleach in the slot allowed for the machine. It is hard to hold the bottle of bleach and make sure it is in the slot requested and not the softener area. Too close. Washes clothes well.\n",
      "Overall, I would give this one 4 1/2 stars. We love everything about it so far. My only complaint is the beginning of the spin cycle is louder than our old washer. The noise only lasts for 15 seconds or so. Perhaps the load is balancing as the washer drum is speeding up?\n",
      "I love this washer- its designed to weigh the clothes and estimate the length of wash time and modify during the wash if it's more or less... it doesn't ding to let you know it's done, a melody plays!!!\n",
      "Great product! Features and technology are excellent. Very quiet and washes clothes extremely well.\n",
      "I've had my Samsung Front Loader for 7-8 years and I love it.  I do, on average, 20-30 loads per week!  So I'd say I've given the machine a real workout.  The steam function just quit, but I use it without (I have a techie hubby so he knew how to disconnect it safely).  I am just now thinking of passing on the machine, and I will buy another!  Never had a problem with mold, mildew or smell and the inside looks practically brand new.  We have very hard water where we live no problem there.\n",
      "this machine is very good looking not to big and not to small. First time buyer for a washer and dryer from Samsung but now I am hooked, the quality is great a very low noise level when the machine is working. Love all their products.\n",
      "My grandchildren love to help me wash and dry clothes, love pushing and reading the correct buttons\n",
      "We GOT Our Washer & Dryer The End Of Dec. and So Far We Are Very Happy With Our Buy!\n",
      "I bought this model (in Merlot) at Lowes in Dec of 2010.  It worked fine for a few years though it did seem to have odd behaviors  at times.  The time would show some number of minutes and then a few minutes later it would show a higher number and then it would be done in considerably less time than either of the displayed minutes.  Fast forward to December 2016.  Washer showed 2 minutes left and about a minute later I was standing a few feet away loading the dishwasher when I heard a horrendous crashing sound that quite startled me and then it abrubtly  stopped.  I called a repairman and the problem (like so many other front loaders) was the bearing and too expensive to fix.  Cheaper to buy a new one.  I will not buy another Samsung even though doing a lot of washer research over the last week leads me to believe the brand really doesn't matter as the bearings seem to be an issue with many brands.  It seems miele might give you 15-20 years and speed queen 10-12 but I'm not sure they would be worth the cost.As an aside, I also have the sambsung merlot dryer (that was paired with this washer) and it's still going strong so hopefully it will give me a few more years.\n",
      "I have always purchased Samsung products and had no problems whatsoever with any of them. Even Had the Note 7, which was an awesome phone and never had problems with it. such a shame I had to turn it in. thanks for making great reliable products.\n",
      "I've always wanted a front load washer and I love this washer. Use less detergent and softner, plus it uses less water and our clothes come out clean. It's easy to use.\n",
      "I LOVE THE CHIMES, THE STEAMER, SELF CLEAN, RELATIVELY QUIET AND VERY NICE TO LOOK AT IN MY WASH ROOM.\n",
      "I love it! It's pretty, does a great job...what else do I need?\n",
      "Very good price.The cycles are longer that the previous machine we had here but this should not be a problem.For the rest everything is OK.\n",
      "Fantastic machine. Uses one-half the amount of detergent and fabric softener that I previously used and no pre-treating. Shirt collars come clean The wash comes out clean. Dish towels finally have no smell and are clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "Love my washer now it's quite and works wellNow am going to purchase the matching dryer.\n",
      "I have had this washer for about 2 years now. The Drum and Door liner gets very dirty with a orange/brown residue. Running the Self Clean Cycle does not clean it well enough, there is constantly a orange/brown residue inside. I have to use a toothbrush and cloth with bleach about once a month. If I do not do this thorough cleaning the residue ends up getting on white clothes, if you do not catch it before you put your clothes in the dryer it gets baked on. I also have noticed it has gotten very loud and rattles badly when the spinning cycle is on (yes it is level and so is my floor) I have had other front loading brands before and this one is the worst, I would not recommend or purchase again.\n",
      "I see all the high ratings on this product and have to wonder if they got something different than me. I have had nothing but issues and have gone through 3 washers and dryers. Had I not been a previous Samsung front load washer and dryer owner I would think this is a normal issue but unacceptable to me. The washer, although it is level, goes into a spin that will shake anything sitting on top of it onto the floor and rock all over your utility room. Lowe's has been good about exchanging it out until this last issue and I had to get a district manager involved. The problem being the second set had to be ordered putting me over 30 days of purchase but not in using it for 30 days because it was reported on delivery. The matching electric dryer pretty much the same issue with the vibration and the last one I got sounds like it has a tennis shoe in it when the drum rotates. I guess if I wore hearing aids I could take them out when doing my laundry and not have to listen to it all. Although the laundry comes clean and gets dry, I NEVER had any problem with my previous Samsung set until after 8 years when the drain filter went out. So I have upgraded to the top of the line which should be delivered Tuesday. Just praying there are no issues with these otherwise I may be screaming.\n",
      "This product has a lot of nice features such as steam and sanitizing which is great for soiled garments. I just used it for a few weeks so far and no complaints yet.\n",
      "makes more noise than a herd of mules going downhill backwards.  Sorry I purchased it.\n",
      "Great, quiet, and cleans well. Took a little getting use to the digital indicators but works well so far. Would recommend this one (front loader)\n",
      "I purchased the same model about 5+ years ago, and just like other people, the spider flag (the main shaft of the drum) has corroded, hence the machine is unusable.  Called Samsung and they finally agreed to pay for parts, but not labor.  Anyway, the machine is fixed (but not balanced properly), and guess what, in 5 years will have the same issue, because the replaced the parts with the same part that was corrosive again... very disappointed, the hassle I went through, and the poor quality of the part I mentioned.  I would not buy this product has for the amount of money you pay, and it only lasts about 5 years....\n",
      "It takes me half the time to do laundry now bc this fits so much in a single load!\n",
      "LOVE THE COLOR. SO FAR SO GOOD. JUST ARRIVED YESTERDAY\n",
      "The performance of this washer is very good. It is easy to operate and no problem with electrical components. I would recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "We really like the washer. It has so many features that we can use and it is a little bit bigger then our previous one and hopefully lasts a little bit longer.\n",
      "Energy efficiency and has a great value that is cost friendly\n",
      "LOVE THE STYLE AND COLOR - PERFECT SIZE TO PUT BOTH PIECES TOGETHER WITH DRYER\n",
      "Love the steam feature and the allergen and sanitize cycles. Quiet as a whisper.\n",
      "I had a duet for ten years, but since most of my appliances are Samsung, I opted for this one. I really liked that it had a direct drive belt. Since owning this I had a repairman out within six months to replace an item he had to order. So we were without a washer for over a week. With my duet I NEVER had a smell, with this machine it smells horrible. I clean it as recommended, use only HE soap, and check the filter frequently. When you open the filter, by the way, water pools out everywhere no matter how much I try to control it. I never noticed there was no just spin cycle on it before until I need it. Now the washer door started leaking, and the door just burst open and flooded my pantry, garage, and kitchen. The only problem I had with the duet was someone pushed something up against the door and cracked it, but it ran great. everyone always remarked how great my clothes smelled with duet, but sometimes I have to wash twice now just to get clean. I have had this machine for just over a year. Also I did not receive drying rack with this product that comes with it.\n",
      "This product is a great product. Samsung always have been a great brand I've have always trusted.\n",
      "The only don't like is the washer door. I have push it to make it close. Do you think I should call the company and have it adjusted?\n",
      "For my 1st wash, I put in a bunch of old white towels that I had not been able to get clean and now used as rags. I had tried bleach, presoaks, stain removers and everything else I could think of to try and remove the stains. So to test my ew washer, I just put in the towels and regular laundry soap to see what would happen. I could not believe the results. The towels came out like brand new, with all the old stains removed. Yes, I recommend this washer! Oh, and by the way, it looks beautiful in my laundry room.\n",
      "I bought this washer for my wife, and she loves it! She spent a lot of time looking before deciding on this one. She has wanted it for a long time. I did lots of research into this machine and it's features. As well as compared it to others like it as well as pricing. I think for the money this is the best washer we could have bought. It is high tech and the price is great! We have loved Samsung products for many years.\n",
      "I love my new washer. It is so quiet. I love the idea of being able to sanitize my clothes. It has so many extra options that you can add to each load. I also like that I can save the load that I use the most under My Load and just have to hit one button. I would highly recommend this washer to everyone.\n",
      "I like this product. My only complaint is that there is a limit to the customization on each cycle. I would like to be able to set the temperature and speed no matter the preset cycle. Alternatively, have a \"custom\" cycle choice where there is no preset. It would also be useful to have a light like in the dryer. But I like the rest of the product. The end of cycle music is charming, and the spin cycle really gets most of the water out.\n",
      "GOOD, COMFORTABLE,HEAVY LOADERS,SHINY, COLORFUL AND ATTRACTIVE ,EASY TO USE BY ALL.DURABLE AND OF LIGHT WEIGHT.\n",
      "I purchased this washer as my first front loader. I was surprised at how much longer it takes to wash the clothes than my old washer. Normal takes over an hour. And when I select to wash in Cold water, it takes 16 minutes more than if I washed in Warm water for the same Normal cycle. I can't find a reason why. The washer works well now but it leaked when I got it. A Samsung repairman came and verified that a service bulletin had been issued against my washer for this problem and he fixed it for free. This one also agitates so forcefully that it walks across my floor. I do have laminate flooring so it's easy for things to move across it. The repairman confirmed that most front loaders do that and that having a pedestal would help this a bit. I didn't buy one of those. The other thing that happened is that I shut the washer off mid-cycle. You have to turn it on by using the Power button before you hit Start. Both buttons are on the edge of the front so when I put my hand on the washer mid-cycle, I hit the Power button by accident and shut it off. It had only filled a little bit so not sure that it made that much difference. Overall I'm happy with it. It's just taken some getting used to.\n",
      "Looked at many washers but this washer is awesome love all the features and very quiet would recommend this washer saves water to\n",
      "SO FAR VERY BEST WORK STILL NEED TO WORK MORE WITH ITEM\n",
      "Bought comparable matched set in 2008 from Lowes. Worked well and the a relay on the washer main control board went bad. Samsung NO LONGER has the part available! Long story, but I fix appliances so it is not like I don't know what I am doing or where to source parts. It actually cost me money as a/the authorized part supplier insisted the number I gave them right off the board was not a good one and told me there was a substitute. They sent it to me, it WAS the wrong part, THEN they told me because it was an electrical part they couldn't take it back. AFTER SOME DISCUSSION.... got them to take it back, but I was charged a restocking fee. Additional research confirmed part not available/made anymore. Now Samsung says they warranty the motor parts for 10 years INFERRING it will last AT LEAST that long. What good is that warranty if they don't make CRITICAL PARTS (such as master boards etc. for at least 10 years as well...  thereby FORCING the consumer to dispose and buy another...basically selling disposable appliances..I SWORE I would not give Samsung the money for the replacement, but looking at the replacement options (such as LG and Whirlpools which strangely share some common parts) at purchase time, getting a Samsung replacement and not having to buy an OVER PRICED drawer, was a best financial option running the risk I could run into the same scenario with the replacement...\n",
      "Looks good and has lots of option to choose from. Now testing it and clothes came out great and cleaned.\n",
      "I love my new front load washer it is easy to use , and cleans great.\n",
      "This is an outstanding product. We've only owned it for a couple of months so my review is based on this short time frame. It performs great, and is really efficient and much quieter than our old top load washer. The only suggestion that I would make is that rocking could be eliminated totally during high spin I'm guessing this is because of the pedestal that the machine sets on as we had the opportunity to use the machine without the pedestal and didn't notice rocking during high spin.\n",
      "Have just installed and started using the washer and so far so good. Like the option of steam and a self cleaning button for the drum and seals with a reminder.Also like the easy access for the tub drain line trap.\n",
      "This washer replaced my twenty year old washer. So far this washer has worked and cleaned my families clothes spectacular. I couldn't of made a better decision. I would recommend this washer to anyone looking to upgrade their old set . The price was also great and fit the family budget. Thank You Samsung!\n",
      "Great washer and well built. Color is great and easy to clean.\n",
      "This is 2nd Samsung front load washer I have owned. Best thing I love about it, is it is QUIET when it runs. It accepts large loads and does an excellent job. I also like the fact that I can sanitize the clothes and bed linens.\n",
      "I would recommend to everyone because it's just unbelievable how this thing works.\n",
      "This washer has so many options to choose from. Love that I can program my own cycle to use and not use the preprogrammed one all the time or make adjustments. Looks and works great.\n",
      "I forgot how good clothes could smell!! clothes always smell clean and fresh.\n",
      "Have only been using this washer for week but it's great so far...so my rating is for my experience so far. I hope that it is durable! I got the washer for an amazing price over Black Friday weekend. Pros: Very efficient and quiet! Does a great job with clothes....on high spin the clothes come out feeling hardly wet. The adjustable feet make leveling a cinch and I haven't had any balance problems.  Cons: I wish the lettering on the control panel was backlit for dim basement conditions.\n",
      "The Samsung front load washer is a great machine. I originally had a top load washer but I find that the front load washer is much more efficient and quiet. I would highly recommend the washer to anyone.\n",
      "Super quiet, fast, and efficient. The washer spends the clothes nearly dry! So far no signs of mold or any strange smells.\n",
      "I RECIEVED THIS UNIT TODAY AND INSTANTLY RAN SOME LOADS THROUGH IT. I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HOW WELL THE CLOTHES WERE CLEANED AND SMELT. The unit overall has great features and a fancy look. Very pleased.\n",
      "After tons of reviews that I had read and research, I finally gave it a shot and purchased the washer. I have had it for a month now and used it several times. I have had no issues so far and love the washer.\n",
      "Excellent, I lake de product, this product has great features\n",
      "We have been using this washer for a couple of weeks and love it.\n",
      "There is no interior light. Besides that, I really like this product.\n",
      "This new washer really conserves water. The washer it replaced used a lot of water so this is definitely an upgrade. The features are great and it is easy to use and very quite. Great product.\n",
      "I have only washed a few small loads in this washer thus far, but it does seem to do a great job even on the normal wash setting. There are an intimidating about of options to choose from but it is nice to have the ability to customize and save your custom wash cycles. Ill probably use this feature in the future. I do wish I had control of this machine through my iPhone like the model with the big LCD display... but I just couldn't afford more than what we bought. It could use more wireless function at a lower cost.\n",
      "I am not a laundry aficionado; in fact, I'm happy just having a machine that will wash my clothes. That being the case, this washer is perfect because it has too many features for me to use; it's very quiet, and gets the clothes clean. I'd read about other washers that clunk when they turn the water on/off, vibrate when they are running and are noisy. This washer is the opposite, and at the sale price I paid, I consider it a great buy.\n",
      "Just bought this washer for my wife and she really likes it. It is very quiet, and does great with what it is supposed to do - wash clothes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "We had previously owned a Samsung front load washer years ago, but when it broke down, we couldn't afford a similar machine. We bought a competitor's top load washer that only lasted six years. Now we are back to loving our Samsung front loader. I don't know why some people complained about vibrations, mine is just fine. Loving everything about it!\n",
      "great washer. highly recommended. Was not disappointed with our purchase.\n",
      "I really am glad we purchased our Samsung Washer. We had the dryer and really think that was a great investment and decided to get the Washer. It is large capacity, small amount of detergent necessary, quiet, cleans the clothes. Another great investment for us.\n",
      "We had this for less than a year and bought the extended warranty and it stopped working.I had a repair person com out and deemed it not repairable after four times coming back. Now Lowes extended warranty people has denied my claim stating that a repair guy had to come out four times for the same problem HE CANNOT FIX IT!   Not sure what else I can do!  Paid way to much for it to stop working prior if a year!\n",
      "I am very frustrated with my Samsung washer.  I purchased the machine one year ago this week and I've had the same issue the entire year.  I've called this issue 4-5 times and I've been unable to get any results.  My issue is the washer leaks from underneath and behind every few weeks to a month.  This is the real problem, their service is horrible.  The first time I called this in months ago, I was given a number by Samsung for a mechanic to call me to set something up. No one called, so I called him.  He told me he doesn't deal with Samsung because they never pay him for his work.  He stated he doesn't know how many times he has to keep telling them.  I then called Samsung again, and they told me they would have to locate someone else.  I received a call two days later by Samsung, stating they found a technician that could come out.  That didn't help either.  The tech that came out didn't even do anything.  He looked at the machine, and told my wife she is using to much detergent.  So we reduced detergent, with same problem.  We called this in again.  Same guy, this time, he didn't want to come out.  He stated it was the detergent.  Bottom line is the only issue is the washer has leaked and the washer is rated well.  The problem for you if you buy this and you get a lemon that needs service, good luck.  Samsungs service is horrible.\n",
      "We found we had to read the manual to allow us to change the water temperature. It was surprising to see with permanent press option you cannot change the water temperature. One load we used the bedding setting. This took 90 minutes to complete. There was an extra rinse cycle that we could have deselected. I guess there is a learning curve and an adaptation and a read of the manual is a must. But the features are exciting and I can't wait to try the steamer option.\n",
      "This is very nice machine. There is just one important item that someone forgot to integrate into the design. WHERE IS THE INTERIOR LIGHT??? It gets dark in that drum. I don't know about anyone else, but I like to be able to see what's going on in there! Put the light in please!\n",
      "This is my second front-load washing machine and I'm so glad to have this style back again. For the past four years I've had a top-load washer that came with the home I bought. I used it till I couldn't stand it anymore. I love the front-load machines - everything at eye level especially with the pedestal stands and I don't have to lean over to move clothes from the washer to the dryer. I really believe that front-load machines do a better job and use a lot less water. Win-Win for me.\n",
      "I CAN SAVE MY OWN WASH CYCLE, INSTEAD OF HAVING TO RESET IT ALL OVER AGAIN! NOPE! IT'S AS EASY AS HITTING ONE BUTTON\n",
      "This is the first washer we've ever purchased. We had to slam the lid down on the one that came with our new house in order to get it to start (sometimes multiple times) and this closes so easily and works so easily that I don't know why we didn't buy it sooner! I would definitely recommend this to a friend.\n",
      "This is a great product, especially in terms of looks and design. However once the spin cycle is about to begin and the drum starts to spin it does vibrate quite a bit. Overall great value for your money and looks really good.\n",
      "First of all, wow the improvements! Is is so quiet, hardly hear it. Love all the features but was really wowed with tbe sanitizer features. Had shop towels that always had an order of grease left. Washed and dryed them and no odor!!\n",
      "The washer will clean you clothes with no problem.\n",
      "Ring around basin has to be dried between loads. One extra step and worried about mildew. Also seems to be harder on clothing. Cannot rinse out detergent cap like with a top loader.\n",
      "Quiet, simple to use, and reliable. Steam functionality is awesome!\n",
      "I have several pets that I'm allergic to and the allergen cycle is fantastic! I also love that it is so quiet I wouldn't know it was running from the next room with the doors open if it weren't for the water going into the sink after the wash and rinse. It has more cycles and options than I have needed to use so far but not so many it's overwhelming. I'm really pleased so far!\n",
      "this product is made to order,it look good and easy to use.My wife and I tried the top loader with no suscess.too long to wash and too much water usage so we went back to the front loader. oh happy day. This machine is great .wish we hadn't gone that route . To me it;s worth the money .and washes good .I'd be happy to tell my friends. We'er your for life. Keep moving forward.Happy us\n",
      "Well I have to say this is the best washer we have ever owned , its quit , fast and almost dries the cloths before going to the dyer, I would recommend this to everyone. Fantastic product\n",
      "It is easy to use, uses less water but still does an excellent job. Great result every time.\n",
      "I do not understand how our brand new washer and dryer scratch so easily. All We have is our laundry basket on the top and it has scratched the top of the machine. Ridiculous!\n",
      "I have had my new Samsung washer for 1 month and I love it! It is very quiet, very cost efficient. I also love that it plays a melody rather than the loud buzzer that all my other washers had.\n",
      "We very much like the ease of use and quality of clothes washing.\n",
      "Our loyalty is to our Samsung product from purchasing, phones, TV's, Tablets, etc. My family loves our new Front Load Washer. It is very user friendly for anyone to use. it quite and energy efficient.  I love the fact that my Samsung requires less water and less detergent still getting my clothes extremely clean. My Front Load has many different washing cycles, rinse cycle, and temperatures to select from. It has a steam cycle that is absolutely exceptional and let's not forget the ability to sanitize cycle. I would definitely recommend Samsung Front Load washer machine if you are in the market for a new washer. This Front Load saves on water, electricity, and detergent costs. Samsung stand behind it products. I give the Samsung Front Load 5 stars.\n",
      "SUCH A GREAT UPGRADE TO THE LAUNDRY!! LOVE THE DESIGN AND FEATURES THAT THIS LIL BEAUTY HAS......LOOKS GREAT AS A SET, STACKED....WHEN IT IS WASHING A LOAD, LOOKS LIGHT ART IN MOTION.....IF YOUR LOOKING FOR AN UPGRADE WITH LOTS OF FEATURES AND SETTINGS, THEN THIS IS THE WASHER FOR YOU....\n",
      "my wife love this product both washer and dryer!!!\n",
      "Very nice washer. It is not very loud and has great load capacity. Has plenty of features, the steam wash is great to clean extra dirty clothes and the quick was is great for clothes that aren't that dirty. Very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend.\n",
      "I love this washer and all of the features especially the steam cycle. Only issue is I have not been able to get rid of that slight mildew smell. followed all instructions drying the door gasket and all that stuff and it is still there.\n",
      "The only thing I have a problem with is that we needed the door to open the other way. so will have to rethink the laundry room and positioning of the washer and dry differently\n",
      "This machine is wonderful with the near constant use by my family of 5. It is big enough to wash a king size comforter. Steam function gets the \"work\" smell out of my husbands work clothes. The sounds are a little excessive but that's really no big deal...just turn them off.\n",
      "I love this washing machine. Works perfectly. It also looks really cool!\n",
      "This washer fills the bill for a washer with a variety of features at a reasonable price.\n",
      "Have washed several loads and it was so quiet I didn't know when it had got through. Great washer.\n",
      "WASHES GREAT AND VERY QUIET WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE!\n",
      "Love my new washer, lots of features, design is beautiful, compliments my utility room better than that old white thing. Takes a little while for a load to wash, unless you use the quick wash. But I always add an extra rinse to my loads so it adds a little time. Does a great job on getting my clothes clean. Have no problem with bad smell coming from washer, but I leave the door open after I am done. I also wipe it down after done. Maybe because it is so new and want to keep it looking good. Quiet machine also, could hardly hear it just outside utility room door. Was beginning to think it wasn't washing clothes. Looked inside and sure enough it was running, just as smooth as can be. .\n",
      "i love the look of the finish, it is very simple to install, hook up, and to operate, once you review the operation manual. it is quiet, efficient. i love to have the ability to put the soap, bleach and softener in 1 easy step.\n",
      "The washing machine is 4 months old and has needed multiple repairs. I've been without a washer for 2 weeks now. So annoyed!\n",
      "I love Samsung!! So when I got the washer and dryer I was ecstatic!! My youngest has accidents so the sanitize option has become my best friend!!\n",
      "I PURCHASED THIS WASHER 2 WEEKS AGO. SO FAR IT WORKS WELL AND MY FAMILY ARE PLEASED WITH IT.\n",
      "I absolutely love this washer!!! The features are awesome and the cleaning ability is tremendously great. I am happy with my purchase.\n",
      "this product is so beautiful and excellent. I will recommend this to the others.\n",
      "Amazing washer. I love samsung products. I was looking for a low vibration washer and I got one.\n",
      "This is a great item for the price. So many options to use on this machine.\n",
      "The new washer ran great and still does but on the 5th or 6th load we heard water shoot out the back of the washer. We found that there is a vent on the back up top and that is where water came out. We called NFM and they are sending another unit. I read online that this is a common occurrence on several front load manufacturers. They say to much soap can cause an overflow. I also read that if sometimes the water does not completely drain before spin that the pressure can cause it to come out of vent. Have done 2 more loads since then and it has not happened again. Still a bit of disappointment that they have not included this in possible issues in literature..\n",
      "I like this washer because has a lot of features like steam washer with 9 cycle program, it is easy to use-User friendly- reasonable Price and beautiful design.\n",
      "A huge improvement over our old machine. Quiet and impressive cleaning performance.\n",
      "We got a great deal and free home delivery and installation. The technicians were wonderful taking care not to scratch my wood floors. The washer and dryer are quiet and the dryer keeps up with the washer!!! This is a first EVER in my life. When a load is complete the machine plays a cute little tune no more nasty \"HONK\" sound. We had to leave before the dryer was done, so when I got back (2 days later) my clothes that were left in the dryer were a bit wrinkled (but they were apparently dry) I ran a cycle to release the wrinkles and they were perfect! I LOVE this set. PLUS I got the pretty Merlot set!\n",
      "Performs beyond expectations. 1 Con that we have is the Filter retains water and leaks out all over when you clean it which is recommended every two months. That is a poor design. Other than that we love this machine and just bought a matching dryer recently.\n",
      "Our washer gets off balance often and sometimes does not spin the clothes really well. Other than that we are happy with our purchase.\n",
      "I have only had this machine for a couple of weeks but I have to say that this is a real step up from my prior front loader. I almost chose a top load model and I am so glad I didn't.\n",
      "Moving from an old washer to a new one has been amazing and this washer has done great.\n",
      "Really loving our Samsung washer. My wife and I read reviews about it being loud and we had a momentary experience of it making a loud banging noise. Come to find out, we just had it too close to the dryer and the two were vibrating against one another. The moment I separated them about an inch apart... silence! Definitely pleased with our product and feel it is one of the best purchases we've made so far for our home.\n",
      "AMAZING! Never knew doing laundry could be this effortless. I love the cleanliness of the clothing after washing and no residual dirt or soap. the dryer is wonderful as well (we have the gas dryer). I left the clothes in the dryer 24+ hrs after they completed the cycle and surprisingly they weren't even wrinkled. Now that's superior smart technology. Thank you Samsung for making my hectic life bearable.\n",
      "As stated with our dryer this washer is the best we have owned. Ease of operation and the cleanliness of the clothes is out of this world. From day one my wife was able to use any cycle she wanted with no stress at all and as all us fellows know Happy Wife Happy Life!!!\n",
      "overall design is very good. However, the power lock door is a little over done but it may save a child's life??\n",
      "Fantastic washer, quiet, efficient, never goes out of balance when the kids overload it with towels! The chimes when it completes are the best.\n",
      "So far all is good only ran a few loads through but it all seems to be working fine, i like the red color\n",
      "First day washing with it. We wanted a quality High Efficiency washer at a good price. This washer exceeds our expectations. It's quiet and doesn't tangle or tear the clothes like the agitator washer did. Plus clothes dry a lot quicker because they spin dry much faster. Very nice machine.Would have gotten the one with the little door to be able to add more clothes, but it was 1\" deeper, and it wouldn't have fit (really).\n",
      "I had previously purchased the matching dryer, and saved up to get the washing machine. It wasn't in stock, so I ordered, and waited 2 months for it to arrive. It started out whisper quiet and fast. Within a few months, the machine had grown very noisy during operation. Also the load countdown timer became extremely inaccurate. At around the 4 month mark, I arrived home to find a load of laundry still going in the machine after starting it hours prior. The machine was malfunctioning in the spin cycle, never reaching full speed, and continuing to add rinse water. Repair technician visited, and ordered new \"computer.\" After a week waiting for the part, technician returned and installed it. As soon as he left, we tried a load, and the problem persisted. Waited for another service appointment, and the technician rediagnosed. This time ordering a new drum and shocks. Meanwhile, it was weeks later (3 service calls later), and our dryer was working overtime with our soaking wet clothes. Samsung finally decided to give us 2 options. First was to reorder the same machine, which carried the same 2 month lead time and possibly the same problem. Second option was to return to Lowe's and pick out any washing machine I wanted, pay for it upfront, and when they delivered, they would pick up the broken machine and refund the purchase price. Great in theory, however there were NO comparable machines at the same price point. So in the end I was forced to buy a new, more expensive machine, more expensive warranty as prices had increased, and wait 2 weeks lead time for delivery, all the while paying out of pocket until the eventual refund. This whole experience with Samsung and Lowe's has left scars on my heart and drained my livelihood. This, along with reports of exploding Samsung products across multiple categories and bad experiences I've had with their tvs, and I assure you I will never buy another Samsung product. And I will be shopping for larger ticket items at Home Depot, where I've had better experiences in resolving issues. On a somewhat positive note, both the repair technician, as well as the Lowe's sales associate were extremely kind, friendly, and helpful. Without them I couldn't have survived this process.*(For reference, I reside in an all adult household. And this happened over the summer/fall when normal temps in my area are 100°++. No big bedding, or heavy thick clothing. I also came across a review for the machine on another website, where someone else had the same problem and experience that I did. This tells me that it wasn't a fluke, and that Samsung is not aware of a solution to this particular malfunction.)\n",
      "I have only had this product for a few days, I am very satisfied with the quietness and very low to no vibration during washing cycle. I don't know at this point if the washer will have long lasting durability. It appears to be well made.\n",
      "Purchased this yesterday, and have already been promoting it to other family members on what an awesome purchase this was. Outstanding performance. Love the set!\n",
      "THIS IS MY SECOND SET OF SAMSUNG FRONT-END WASHER. LOVE HOW QUIET IT IS.\n",
      "Quiet washer.There are 9 predefined washing cycles, however, you can still still adjust the water temperature and spin level to fit your load on most of the predefined cycles. You can always have your own customize cycle - \"My Cycle\"\n",
      "This is my first washer I've ever owned and I love it! I just love washing clothes with this washer and it's so easy to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "THE FEATURE THAT I LOVE WITH MY WASHER IS THE SANITIZE CYCLE BECAUSE IT HELPS TO ELIMINATE PRE-TREATING A GARMENT. ALSO, GREAT IS THE ALLERGEN CYCLE. THIS IS A WONDERFUL ADDITION TO HELP WITH MY ALLERGIES, IT IS A REAL \" PLUS \". IT IS A QUIET WASHER BUT IT WILL BEEP TO LET ME KNOW MY WASH IS COMPLETED !\n",
      "I find it does a much better job with all types of clothes. I like the quick feature for those times of need.When installing I had to remind installers of the steam \"package\". They almost didn't hook it up correctly. So might want to double check on that.\n",
      "I thoroughly enjoy my new washer. The best feature is the cleanliness of the clothes once washed. They smell so amazing. It's easy to use and is overall outstanding. If I had any complaints it would be how long some of the settings take to wash the clothes. But once you dry them and that clean smell hits you, the time is a thing of the past just like the dirt.\n",
      "Really like all the features on this washer. Looks good, easy to install. First front loader and I love it.\n",
      "Brought a beautiful front loader that  had issues regarding the drum balance after 4 years. The drive shaft bent and the machine was useless. Cost as much to replace the drum and drive shat as to buy a new machine. These machines don't last very long and would not recommend them if you expect them to last 5 to 10 years. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Looks great. Cleans great with many options for various clothing. \"My Cycle\" saves my most used washing choices which allows me to start a load with one touch of a button\n",
      "This product is well worth the money !!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "One of the problem I ran was that the machine shakes a lot when it's doing the rinsing\n",
      "Love the washer, its got tons of options and is very quite...\n",
      "Products is amazing. Very efficient. Cleans clothes perfectly. Steam feature is on point !\n",
      "Our 3rd front loader. Much improved over others. Operates quietly and efficiently. Not too many cycles (a good thing) and good flexibility in the controls (extra rinse, spin speed, etc.)\n",
      "I've had my washer for about a year, and only had one issue. When I called to put in a service order, the gentleman I spoke with was very professional and helpful. The repairman callen the next day and it was fixed in no time! Very easy! And the only issue was the computer needed reset. Otherwise, it has been a great washer! I love it!\n",
      "I'm not one to normally 'only' write negative reviews, but after having high hopes for this it falls short.The absolute great thing is the reduction in water usage.  OR more importantly, the small about of water it expels to our septic tank/drain field.  This solved a problem we were having.  Lowes delivery was wonderful as well.  One thing, normally they will haul off your old appliance for free, I think, but there was lots of confusion about it they would do that for us.  They wanted to charge us a fee.  But they took out old one for free eventually.  When you order online, it causes confusion as there wasn't a spot to mark that I wanted my old one hauled away.  After a call from the delivery people it was taken care of.  The washer looks great but is very noisy.  I guess I though they were supposed to be quiet.  This one squeaks every time the tub goes around.  and almost sounds like it's off balance.  Squeak.Squeak.Squeak.  This is whether it has a large load or very small one.  Maybe we got a bad one, and pretty soon I may call and have them come take a look at it.  They are Very Heavy, so look out for that.  I think he said around 300 pounds.  For cleaning, it does a great job and I like the low water usage and small amount of detergent you use, good for those with sensitive skin.  There are only 2 of us in the house, but our water bill went down $8 per month since purchasing this.\n",
      "Does everything it says. The steam washer makes my clothes look better than normal. Highly recommend this product.\n",
      "I bought this washer a month ago and I am very disappointed with the excessive vibration during the spin cycle. I followed all the instructions and installation recommendations to level the machine and it is still terrible. I have it installed on the second floor and now even my ceiling has cracks.Very poor choice to buy a front loader washer.\n",
      "No matter how big or small the wash load is, when the cycle stops, the clothes are in a knotted mess. I've tried putting tennis balls in the machine to ward off the result, but that didn't work. I contacted Samsung and after 10 months, they have had no response. For what I paid for this machine (and the matching dryer, which has the exact same issue), I should not have this problem. Clearly, the design is faulty. Save your money and buy something else.\n",
      "Its easy to use and with the care app i will be able to know whats wrong with my washer... next month we are gettung the dryer!!\n",
      "Good so far, only on the first day. no problems yet. I like to steam option.\n",
      "My clothes do not get clean. I've used different detergents and it makes no difference. It does not allow enough water to clean unless I wash one sheet, one pair of pants etc, at a time. Just as much water is used in four loads as would be used in one good load. One good load equals energy and time efficiency. Probably cleaner clothes, too, because you have more water. It takes water to clean clothes. I would like to be able to control the water level. The old machines did that. Who in the world came up the design on these new machines?\n",
      "When we got the recall notice for our top loader we we very disappointed. However, my wife is absolutely thrilled with her new front loader. It is very quiet and has a steam feature she loves.\n",
      "Owned this and matching electric dryer for 6 mos now.  I hate them both equally.  As far as cleaning, they do as advertised.  The washer will not stay level, causing the spin cycle to sound more like a demolition derby.  I have to move the machine back to its rightful place after every 3rd load or so.  The door will not close unless it is shut \"just right\".  Once refused to ever buy anything Samsung again.  I should have stuck to my guns.  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra couple hundred for the LG equivalent. My old LG was night and day better than this set.\n",
      "WE JUST BOUGHT THE WF42H5200AF FRONT LOAD WASHER TO REPLACE A 10 YEAR OLD VERSION OF IT. WE HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE OLDER UNIT BUT WANTED TO UPGRADE TO THE NEWER UNIT WHILE IT WAS ON SALE AND WE COULD SAVE GETTING THE NEW ADDED FEATURES.  WE ARE RETIRING THE OLDER WASHER TO OUR WORK SHOP TO WASH DIRTY COVERALLS... WE ARE EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH BOTH OF OUR Samsung FRONTLOAD WASHERS...\n",
      "Working Great so far. Very Happy with our purchase.\n",
      "This washer has some amazing features and is the quietest washer I have ever owned. I had to check on it several times to ensure it was running. Easy to use, durable, quiet and cleaned clothe s exceptionally well. I put some clothes that had previous stains that my old Whirlpool washer didn't get out in, used only detergent. When it was done washing the stains were gone. I couldn't believe it!Highly recommend it. It was well worth the money!\n",
      "Simplicity is a very useful feature when it comes to using an appliance that one normally dreads. You push a button and it does the one thing it is designed to do. I'm glad to see that this washer gets as close to it as can be done. Should you need to select a wash cycle other than the default, there are plenty of options, or you can add your favorite as needed. Then, it's a single button operation again. Operation is very quiet, unless there are metal clothing pieces tumbling around in the machine, or the legs are not leveled and the appliance is wobbly especially during spinning. Steam is the only feature that one might utilize in addition to regular wash cycles. It works quite well and the price difference from a lower model becomes justified. Longevity remains to be seen. Original factory warranty (1yr) is too short, and is the main reason for missing an overall star. Customer service has not been needed or contacted so far. Hopefully it will remain that way.\n",
      "Well, I'm on my 3rd one in the last 5 months.  My previous washing machine was a Samsung front load and it worked perfect.  Too bad it sold with my other house.  So I decided to replace it with a new Samsung front load and I've had nothing but problems.  It looks/sounds like the drum is about ready to bust out the door when it's running through the spin cycle.  I'm going to replace it with a different brand.  So bummed about this.\n",
      "I love my new washer, has quite a few features, also bought the matching dryer\n",
      "I bought this washer because our old one broke down. I decided to try a new washer after using old cheap used washers. Everyone in the family is enjoying this new appliance experience. Still wish everything did not cost so much because I would have loved to get a \"smarter\" machine and a dryer too. Also looking forward to the energy savings.\n",
      "I love my washer. I use it all the time. :)It can be a little noisy while it balances itself out and the pump apparently has given out within 9 months of its purchase but it doesn't deter me from detergenting my garments.\n",
      "I love this product.!!!! Very dependable and spacious.\n",
      "The power button is in a bad location. Already bumped it twice while it was washing and shut it off.\n",
      "The washer works great, however, there is not enough water dispersed in in each load.\n",
      "Good value for good product. Works a lot better then old washer and saves on water usage.\n",
      "Loving the sanitizing options for washing and drying my kiddos clothes.\n",
      "This was my first high efficiency front load washer and was so happy when I bought it. Then it started getting louder on the spin cycle. You must keep cleaning filter to keep smell at bay and I recommend leaving door open for mildew is a big issue.  Now it is too loud to even run it and in the end it kept re-cycling and I had to manually cut it off.  Everone says it is due to the zinc parts corroding since up against alluminum parts.  Samsung says it only has a 1 year warranty. I am not a rich person who can replace appliances every 6-7 years.  I need them to last. I am laundromat bound.\n",
      "my wife loves it . It runs quietly and the cycle takes longer time than our old washer. she loves the spinning time , it makes the clothing more drier the the top loader washer we had before.\n",
      "Best front load I have owned. Super hot wash with sanitize cycle is the best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\n",
      "Purchased both the washer and dryer.  In less than 2 years, we've had to repair the washer twice and the dryer once.\n",
      "I bought this washer and dryer because the specs say it is 27\" wide.  I already had to change my choice once because my first choice was 29\" wide and my closet door is 28\". When I received this washer and dryer, it was 28\", not 27\" like the ad states. Needless to say, I had to have someone remove the whole door facing on one side in order for it to fit.The washer also won't stay balanced.\n",
      "CLEANS MUCH BETTER THAN THE TOP LOAD UNITS. VERY EASY TO USE.\n",
      "Great washer with great features. Best product money can buy.\n",
      "I have been problem with washer please contact meMy washer having problem all the time\n",
      "So far I am loving my new washing machine. I had decided to purchase a new one because my old top loader was not cleaning my clothes well enough. Often my gym clothes were left with a bad smell even after washing twice sometimes. With my new washer I put all my smelly gym clothes in a load together on the sanitize cycle and my problem is solved. Everything comes out smelling amazing.\n",
      "I like my new washer it's very quiet and smooth also looks great\n",
      "Love the washer. The cleaning feature is the best where you don't have to add any chemicals to clean the asher\n",
      "I have never had a front load washer before so this is my first, and i can tell you i am very satisfied with the design, color and performance . I would recommend this to all my family and friends.\n",
      "Best decision we made when we bought this product. Very quiet, capable of washing large loads (8 sets of twin sheets), separate container if you use liquid detergent. Design complementing matching dryer. Recommend to everyone!\n",
      "I've only had this washer a month, but so far so good! This washer has more features then I'll probably use, but it's nice to have the options. I have used the Steam and Sanitize option many times to help with extremely dirty or smelly clothes.  I was worried about the spin vibration, which has been a concern with some models, but it's not an issue with my machine.It's nice to have the self clean option and the easy front filter to clean to help with bacteria smell, which is a problem with some front loaders.\n",
      "Horrible product! Owned only six months and already broken. The drum and bearings completely fell apart.  The whole machine was rocking so hard I thought it was going to tip over.  Lowes AND Samsung have been completely useless and couldn't care less about customer satisfaction!  I will NEVER buy another Samsung product. NEVER!\n",
      "use it for my first wash it shake very very very badly on high speed spin ... pretty sure it on a flat surface ,\n",
      "My old washer just broke and I was in search of something new. Because I love their phones I decided to buy the washer and dyer as well due to all it can do. Overall I love it and love how fast it washes and how clean my clothes are after.\n",
      "I had to check on it several times to make sure it was running, it's so quiet! My daughter loves the chime at the end of the cycle. She's ready to wash her own clothes now...\n",
      "This washer performs better in virtually all areas compared to the unit I replaced it with. The clothes come out less wet and it's noticeably quieter. The controls are also much better. And on laundry day the speed and performance of this washer trims at least an extra hour off.\n",
      "Everything is perfectly functional but the gasket around the door that is not draining water perfectly creating a bad smell unless you are drying it all the time.\n",
      "What a Value! Our Samsung WF5200 4.2 cu. ft. Front Load Washer performs phenomenally. My old washer and dryer were only 10 years old, but WOW, what a difference 10 years makes. I am amazed at how much better this washer and dryer perform compared to my old units. After the second or third load of laundry was taken out of the dryer I was amazed at how soft and fluffy my dry cloths and towels feel- and I have not needed to use any fabric softeners or dryer sheets at all!I absolutely love my new Samsung Washer and Dryer. I bought this pair based on #1-size. I have limited clearance for the doors to open, and this pair measures perfectly- with a little room to spare. And #2-price. These units were some of the most reasonably priced front loading washer and matching dryers available, and I cannot be happier with my purchase\n",
      "This washer that is 2/3 the price of my old one, is just as good. Very pleasantly pleased by its performance!\n",
      "I love my samsung front loader washing machine. Very happy with my choice.\n",
      "My wife and I purchased this in a combo and have them stacked to save room in our utility room. This dryer is awesome, it will dry double and triple loads in a lot less time and the options are very easy to use and they work great. Would highly recommend!\n",
      "Love it so far! It cleans reall well and I love the looks\n",
      "Really happy with our purchase! I love the washer and how well it cleans. One thing that I dont like it the fact that you have to buy the pedestals and that they are such expansive add ons for just a drawer. The washer is so low I have to get on my knees to get the clothes out which is taking a toll on my back.\n",
      "We previously were using an agitator type washer and thought that our clothes were coming out clean..... WOW what a difference in appearance when washed in this new front load washer..... should have purchased this way sooner than now........ definitely recommend this washer !!!!\n",
      "Just like the matching dryer - this is an absolutely beautiful machine. Capacity is large, so I can save energy by washing bigger loads - and it saves me time too! I had a little glitch with the door latch after about 6 months, but the support team responded professionally and kindly - getting me a warranty covered service call scheduled immediately, and my machine was back in service the next day. That's amazing!\n",
      "GREAT WASHER WITH GOOD CAPACITY, LOVE ALL THE SETTINGS THAT IT HAS.\n",
      "My previously purchased Samsung washer had an issue with the inside tub making a scraping sound and then died on me within a week. So looked on line and for a replacement and found the H5200 for a great price and had it delivered six days later. My wife and I couldn't wait to get home to use it.\n",
      "We purchased the Front Loading Washer and Dryer pair and are very pleased with these products!\n",
      "I cannot believe that there are so many options to help one do laundry better. The unit is so quiet and easy to use. I do not know why we waited so long to replace our worn out washing machine. Great color choice for the house. Thank you Samsung\n",
      "Stay away from this samsung. Sold hour house and the buyers wanted the washer and dryer. Bought this washer for new house after having previous samsung for 3 years with no problems. What a mistake. Returned 1st one bc it was making an awful squeaking noise when going into a spin cycle. 2nd one sounded like it was tumbling rocks a month after we received it. Literally sounded like it might explode. Decided to give samsung one last try and returned it for a 3rd. On the first load, 3rd one began squeaking horribly any time it spun and the drum was bouncing up and down like it was not held in properly. None of these issues were \" normal\" sounds or vibrations by any means. Needless to say, we're done trying with samsung.  Lowes has been extremely great through this process. We are exchanging our entire set...washer/dryer/pedestals for a different brand. Do not buy samsung. You'll only have problems.\n",
      "IT IS ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT AND SO EASY TO USE. THE PRICE WAS OVERALL VERY GOOD. I SUGGEST THIS PRODUCT JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY.\n",
      "Best washer I've ever owned. Very convenient and beneficial.\n",
      "This is one of the best washer's I've ever purchased. It's beautiful sleek design looks amazing in my home. My clothes have never felt cleaner.\n",
      "Washer and dryer came yesterday.  Dryer is a steam dryer.  Unless I don't know anything, you need water to create steam.  Lowes delivery didn't hook up any water to the dryer, just plugged it in.  Ran the first load in the washer this morning and the thing shakes like you wouldn't believe.  You would think they would test this when installing.  Unit is too heavy for me to move myself to level with the stacking drawer below the washer.  Also noticed they didn't install all the parts on the washer, had to do it myself.  Now I have to wait another week for Lowes to come back out here and fix everything... VERY POOR service.\n",
      "Very user friendly. It tells you what to do. Love the coin, hair trap. Quiet.\n",
      "I have never been so pleased with drying my clothes in my whole life. My fiance and I are so pleased! No more waiting 2 hours for clothes to get dry! Thank you samsung. Happy wife equals happy life!\n",
      "It is just the best washer I have ever had so COOL!\n",
      "We just purchased our washer and Dryer a couple of weeks ago. So far I love these beautiful machines, They hold a lot or a small load without having to adjust the amount of water, love the features they are so quiet I don't even know they are running.\n",
      "Washed 15 loads so far, and everything is working as expected. Good value for the money.\n",
      "My whole family loves the new washer and dryer. Love all the features it offers especially the steam cycle and it is very quiet compared to my old washer and dryer. And the best thing about it is that i am saving a lot in me electric and water bills. I would not change Samsung for any other brand.\n",
      "I love this product and does wash very good and also recommend to some friends of mine\n",
      "Just finished installing washer and my wife used it all last night and today for many loads. Cleans great, spins out great and leaves little moisture to give the dryer a break. Looks great as a pair together, The door appears on the weak side for latching and opening just hope it holds out for 16 years like my last washer which did not quit but was time for an upgrade.\n",
      "We bought this based on features and prices plus we have other samsung products we enjoy. We TVs, and Refrigerators at Home and Church that so far we are pleased with. Washer seems to work well. Hoping it will last us a long time!\n",
      "We ordered this washer as part of a set. Still haven't used all the features but can vouch for the sanitizing feature which not only thoroughly disinfects clothes but also helps to neutralize some pretty egregious pet odors. Simple to use with enough bells and whistles to please all but the most hard core technophile (you can only run diagnostics on your phone - not operate the appliance).\n",
      "I truly have enjoyed my dryer and washer after it was delivered. I immediately started finding things to wash and dry that really didn't to be washed or dried. The features are amazing. This is a great upgrade coming from top loaders. LOVE THEM TO THE FULLEST!!!!!!\n",
      "Clothes smell and feel GREAT! Finish tone very pleasant unlike annoying buzzer type\n",
      "Everyone compliments the look of this pair! Love it\n",
      "very easy to see the controls and I enjoy the little jiggle when it goes off\n",
      "I'm enjoying my new washer and dryer. Works well and is super sleek looking.\n",
      "Went from having a washer that over soaked clothes, didn't wash, and was forced to do small loads. All of those problems have been fixed.\n",
      "Recently purchased excited to use. Looks great in open area mud room.\n",
      "This product has great performance and features. I love Samsung products. I used this product 5 month. I recommend SAMSUNG to my friends.\n",
      "GREAT WASHER I JUST WISH I WOULD BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH SMART PHONE.\n",
      "This is my second Samsung washer & I absolutely love it!! My clothes are cleaner & softer plus I'm saving money using less detergent, water and electric!\n",
      "I went through two top load washers before buying this front loader. The top loaders were terrible at washing our clothes, each load would still come out smelling so I was washing loads twice. Not the case with this front loader. Clothes tumble and so are properly agitated with less water. They come out clean the first time - every time. Also this machine is very quiet while running. Another thing I appreciated was the thoroughness and comprehensibility of the instruction manual.\n",
      "It is so quiet the features are great it even plays music when cycle is done how cool is that\n",
      "I feel as if I have stepped out of the dark ages with the purchase of my new Samsung front load washing machine. At first I was a little overwhelmed with all the features on the new Samsung washer in comparison with my old top load unit. I quickly discovered how easy to use and efficient this machine is. My bedding and clothing have never been cleaner or fresher smelling. I couldn't be more pleased with the performance and appearance of my beautiful new Samsung front load washer.\n",
      "never will buy a samsung product. First time it broke down, a service guy came out after 2 weeks of notice. Repair was covered under manufacturer warranty. Now it broke down the second time.\n",
      "Worth for $$$$ and would suggest this product. Impressed.\n",
      "After four years our our 4.2 cu ft front load machine machine had a catastrophic break down.  burning rubber black smoke poured out from a bent drum shaft/bracket/bearing.  Samsung agreed verbally to pay for labor and sent out a local repair sgent.  Once reporting back problem, Samsung refused to pay for any labor and would not offer any rebate or other resolution.  The bent shaft problem can be seen on the web.\n",
      "This is an awesome affordable upgrade!!!! I have two small children and as you know we go thru a lot of dirty clothes!!! Hands down it has cut down on my laundry time!!!!\n",
      "We previously owned a Samsung front load washer and front load dryer for 10+ years. We decided to purchase new ones in stainless steel. Our previous washer and dryer were white and we gave them to a family in need. We never had any issues with our previous machines and that's why we decided to purchase again.\n",
      "Quite, throughly washes, wonderful features and love the design\n",
      "have used this model before and very happy with it. Good value for price. Gentle musical sound and does not shake. cleans great and is energy efficient\n",
      "Washer looks good and runs quiet, can't wait to try all the features\n",
      "Excessive mold issues, mold internally that you cant see unless you disassemble the drum.  Major part failure at only 5 years, a know defect that samsung customer service ignores but knows very well.  Look at the pictures.  That is mold inside the drum, you cant see it unless you disassemble the machine.  The corrode part has an inch thick of corrosion, finnally cracking.  Repair was $400 by a technician so I had to do it myself.  Do not buy a SAMSUNG.  Look at the pictures, there is a pic of the replacement part.  Our clothing was being washed in this mess.  Also, all the internal hoses were full of mold and smelled horrible.\n",
      "This washer has great features, great value and Samsung always has the quietest operation.\n",
      "great products with nice design and features. worth to buy!\n",
      "Great machine all the bells and whistles without the huge price tag\n",
      "Really is a good value for all the feature that you will get a out of a front load. Checked the competitors and found Samsung had all the same or more features than all the rest of the brands. To bad that Samsung is getting all the bad and negatives about the products lately. I really enjoy this washer.\n",
      "I needed a new washer. I was sick and tired of going to the Laundromat. The Samsung washer was an amazing deal for a flawless product. Love the steam option and the color!\n",
      "Love my new Samsung washer large loads professional cleaning!!!\n",
      "This is my first Samsung product. I am very happy with it's performance.\n",
      "Machine has easy to use settings, it is very quiet, and allows me to program the washing time.\n",
      "This product has great features/great color and very nicely design and the internet feature make it even better}........I'm Loving it.Good job Samsung\n",
      "My wife is really happy with her new samsung washer and dryer.\n",
      "I love this washer. My cloths have never been cleaner.\n",
      "Just moved to a Samsung product for the first time. Love the look of it, it has great features and is easy to operate. It comes in a choice of several colors too. I especially like the steam feature. It makes the minimum noise too and therefore is suitable for any location. Love my new Samsung Front Load Washer.\n",
      "This washer is very sleek, my wife loves them. I noticed they're very quiet and smooth. The clothes to seem to come out fresh, no odors. I have to say it was a great purchase\n",
      "We have only had this washer for a few days, but it is awesome. I love all the options and look forward to using them all. We have already used the bedding cycle several times; the clothes come out so clean. We had some trouble getting the stacking kit, but now everything is great.We bought the washer and the dryer in merlot and are very happy.\n",
      "The washer vibrated excessively since we bought it, I tried leveling it a couple times and after running the calibration the water stopped flowing into the machine.  This is two month after purchase.  The only worse than this washer is Samsung customer service.  The do not respond to you.  They say they will, but in the end they do nothing.  Luckily Lowes is willing to help.\n",
      "Very happy with the purchase. Great design and has great features.\n",
      "We've only had the washer and dryer for a few weeks, but our quality of life has improved tremendously by not having to deal with the quirks and squeals of old appliances. The design is sharp, and even the sound effects make it feel like it's a premium set of devices. So far, zero issues. In fact, it works too well - the laundry is constantly done so it constantly needs folding! But really, it is worth it - get one (get both).\n",
      "Super efficient, great features, quiet. Love the music and sound effects.\n",
      "The biggest waist of money me and my wife have ever spent. Samsung customer service is absolutely horrible. I will never purchase another Samsung product period. Our washer has been broken for 5 weeks now and the technician has been to the house 5 times replacing different parts. Samsung will not warranty out the washer and bring a new one in until the technician replaces and rebuilds the entire unit and it still doesnt work. The Samsung washer and dryer is only 6 months old. To pay that amount of money for a brand new washer/dryer set and have to go to a laundry mat to wash your clothes for as long as we have been is ridiculous. Washer is still broken now and the technician won't be back for another week to replace another garbage part. JUNK! Should be a ZERO star overall rating but it won't let me.\n",
      "We bought both the washer and dryer and paid upwards of $1900 for both. The washer has had to be repaired 4 times for various issues, the dryer 3 times. I take good care of my appliances and paid for what I thought was a good machine that would last as long as the cheap builder model they replaced. I was wrong. Now I am told the machine would cost over $1100 to fix so here I go to buy an LG which is the brand the tech recomended to me. He added that the life expectancy of the Samsungs is about 7-8 years.\n",
      "Several attempts made to \"balance\" but it's still ridiculously loud! It's the drum --- bad design!\n",
      "Got the machine home; spent several hours installing and when I pushed the power button the machine did not power up. Contacted store were the machine was purchased and having to wait days for them to deliver a new machine. BAD EXPERIENCE with a brand new machine.\n",
      "I just purchased a new set and I am so very pleased. I had my last set for 8 years and I look forward to having this set 8 years or more. The style is exquisite and the color and finish is so beautiful. I shared my new set with friends and neighbors and they agree that it is beautiful and a great value. It runs so quietly and efficiently. I am truly happy and excited with my purchases. Thank you Samsung for good quality and value.\n",
      "how do I start..first time Samsung washer and dryer .gave up on other top brands..went thru 3 washers in 8 years ! so figure try Samsung set. I have 3 Samsung tvs, Samsung smart watch,Samsung tablet, Samsung DVD player and 2 Samsung cell phones ..so I figured since I am such a fan of this brand why not try there washer and dryer set...my thought has to be great since I have every thing else Samsung ! The washer and dryer did not let me down ! excellent . my HD 42 inch Samsung TV is 10 years going not a problem ! again winner with Samsung ! Thanks Samsung just love your stuff\n",
      "I have only had my washer for a few days. I am very impressed with the quietness. The size of the drum is amazing I can double almost triple the load of my previous large capacity washer. The clothes are so clean. There so many features, I especially love the steam which probably eliminate the need for bleach. I will definitely tell my friends and family on there next washer purchase to get a Samsung . So far so good. I have to mention again about the quietness of this washer it is truly amazing.\n",
      "I have had nothing but issues with this product since I have purchased it. I have had a technical come out and service both my washer and dryer multiple times. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Look into other front loaders that aren't Samsung.\n",
      "Love this washer and all it's features. Love to wash all kinds of clothes; dark, perm press, delicates, whites, etc. Everything comes out so clean and doesn't get mistreated.\n",
      "This is our first front load washer and it is great. We will not go back to a top load wash again just for the ease of use and accessibility.\n",
      "This washer is a great size to keep up with all the laundry our busy family goes thru. Extremely quiet while running. Looks great. Gets clothes clean. Added bonus is the steam option on this set. Works great. Definitely recommend.\n",
      "Features are great. Have just received product, so cannot speak to the operation or use at this time.\n",
      "This is my first Samsung washer but already I know I am going to be a happy camper! Was without a washer for days...Caught up in hours. Quiet and efficient. Exactly what I expected. Just remember...Front load washer...leave the door cracked so drum will dry. ;)\n",
      "I love it, easy to use and keeps my clothes very clean\n",
      "great washer at a great price--plenty of features that i will never use\n",
      "The look of this washer can simply not be beat and I get compliments on it all the time. The reason for the low rating is there has been a funky smell since this washer was delivered and I can not figure out how to get rid of it, Also there is a dent at the top of the washer. At first I thought it was supposed to be like that but I also ordered the matching dryer and realized it is a flaw. I do like the performance, it runs pretty quietly, can do without the musical tones though\n",
      "Very awesome product installation equipments are included. super duper awesome.\n",
      "I have not had any problems, setup was easy and I used a stacking kit which saves a lot of space. I would recommend the purchase as this machine is beautiful and inexpensive compared to other brands\n",
      "Just purchased unit and already ran 4 loads through it seamlessly. Only problem was the door latch had not been tightened. Nothing a screwdriver could not fix (after confirming with customer support the latch it supposed to be tight). This is my first Samsung appliance. Hope is lasts longer than the LG steam washer it replaced (12yrs on that one)\n",
      "Happy with this appliance, but beware that this particular model does not allow for the door to be reversed.\n",
      "I replaced this washer with the same style because it is exposed in the kitchen. The spider in back is known to fail because the design allows debris to build up and cause wear. Samsung needs to fix this design. I will not buy another washer from them until they do. The washer needs to be disassembled to make the repair. It is not worth it.\n",
      "We had to find a replacement to our barely year old whirlpool top load washer. This is what we should have bought in the first place! We love how quiet it is. Great Product.\n",
      "I defininelty would recommend this washer to anyone! Easy to load and clean, very quite.\n",
      "Owned the washer and dryer set for 7 years. Replaced 3 heating elements and 2 drive belts. Between this and our Samsung refrigerator I advice every one to stay away from Samsung, even their phones.  Bought the washer, dryer, and the fridge new when we moved and have had nothing but issues. Very disappointed.\n",
      "This product was a good value for the features it has. Salesman was knowledgeable about product.Good experience with installers, very polite young men.\n",
      "Like many I've read here we have uncontrollable vibration and noise issues from the washer.  It's leveled per instrucitons on a tile floor.  All the packing screws are out. On spin up nothing but walking and screeching. We've tried rubber pads and mats but to no success.  This is not just the last front loader, but the last Samsung ever for us. It's less than two years old.  On top of that even though we let the door stay open to dry and use monthly cleaning tablets there is still mold buildup in the soap dispenser.\n",
      "Washer squeaks when starting to spin. You can hear the tub suspension springs expanding and contracting. We installed this unit in a Master Bedroom Bathroom. We will not be able to run the machine overnight.\n",
      "This washer performs as advertised. It can handle all loads and is a workhorse! Very impressed with all the anticipated consumer features. It is stackable and fits into just about any recess.\n",
      "I love the steam cycle, it improves the washing of my clothes. And I now have a self cleaningcycle, which my machine alerts me it's time to clean.\n",
      "I just bought this washer (and matching drier) last Sunday and it is everything I hoped it would be! It works absolutely great and is so quiet and does not rock or shake when washing large loads! By boyfriend is a plumber, so his work clothes get quite disgusting.. I did a load of his work clothes the second day we got this washer and they came out SO clean and soft and smelling great! The color upgrade was well worth the $50 also. I highly recommend this washer to anyone looking for a front-loading new sleek washer.\n",
      "When I last reviewed this dryer, I had very little positive to say about it.  The tumbling continually turned any size sheets into a ball, and I would stand in front of the dryer during the entire cycle, unraveling the ball so the sheets would dry.The dryer was replaced by Samsung, and delivered again by Lowes.  This dryer is a DREAM.  Dries quickly.  The steam function certainly removes/prevents wrinkling, although clothes do NOT come out looking ironed.\n",
      "I really like the many settings available on this washer. I see a noticable difference in how much cleaner the clothes come out. The only issue so far is that the washer shakes quite a bit during the spin cycle even after it was calibrated per the manual's instuctions.\n",
      "I have never had a washing machine that took over an hour to wash a normal load of clothes. To its credit it doesn't use a lot of washer and appears to be very energy efficient.\n",
      "Very nice looking appliance that does more than I ever imagined a washer could do.\n",
      "VERY SLEEK AND STYLISH PRODUCT AND IT IS VERY QUIET\n",
      "MY WIFE LOVES EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MACHINE ! GREAT DESIGN,QUIET AND CLEANS GREAT !\n",
      "We are absolutely impressed by our new washer. It is amazing how little water is uses yet how much cleaner the clothes are vs. a standard top loading washer. I am very, very pleased so far!! Thank you Samsung for a great product!!\n",
      "This machine does a great job washing clothes quickly. The Quick Wash cycle washes everything very well in only 27 minutes. If you put this washer on a pedestal you will have to take more time leveling it. It tends to vibrate more during the spin cycle when on a pedestal vs. sitting on the floor. This is true with ALL front loaders.\n",
      "Love my new Samsung front load washer. Saves water and is very efficient. Love the look of the Platinum.\n",
      "just purchased washer and so far it is very easy to use, quit, and looks nice\n",
      "Efficient use of water and electricity. Adequate load capacity. Washes reasonably well and in a reasonable period of time. On spin cycles, washer is unbalanced and shakes and walks despite being properly and firmly leveled and being on a solid concrete floor.\n",
      "It works well, and seems efficient and effective. Great color \"metallic\", and am impressed by the performace, very nice!\n",
      "I love my new washer/dryer set. They are very quiet when in operation and my clothes come out clean every time.\n",
      "I am still learning, however, I feel my clothes are much cleaner when they come out of this washer than my last one. The only thing I wish was different is the sound. Wish it were a bit louder. Also, I live in a doublewide and this washer is very quiet when it runs loads and does not make loud noises or vibrate when it is in the spin cycle. I don't have to spend extra money on washer cleaner. I don't have to leave the door open all the way after using this washer. It stays where I put it. Most of them are either all the way open or closed. This is the 3rd set of front loaders I have had here, first I used 8 years. Second set I used only two years and took a great loss on them when I sold them. Both were different brands.\n",
      "Excellent size, design, and performance. This machine uses very little water and thoroughly cleans all types of laundry very well.\n",
      "Very easy to use works great so far.very easy for those who are use to simpleness\n",
      "Love the washer's features. I especially love how quiet it is. Gets my cloths clean and smelling good. Did i mention it is quiet?\n",
      "I am recently retired and as such my wife is still working. Our last washer broke so since I do the wash now my wife said \"pick out your new washer\"! I chose this model because even in the store it seemed a \"NOVICE\" laundry person LIKE ME could operate it! I'm glad I got it and it IS easy to use and the clothes come out clean!\n",
      "Washer works very well, higher capacity. Less loads to wash, the clothes, sheets towels, all of it is very clean. Awesome!!! I have more time for family!! Thank you\n",
      "We purchased this product - Merlot Color - purchased both washer and drier December of 2010 - and loved it.  It worked excellent until June of 2015 when the dryer stopped working.  I had purchased the extended warranty but of course could not find the paperwork and couldn't find it - both Samsung and Lowe's told my husband they had no record of the Warranty.  So we paid $300 for someone to come and fix the dryer - apparently it needed a belt.  Then in December of 2015 the Washer stopped working -wouldn't drain.  Called for warranty assistance, again nobody had any information about my extended warranty so we paid the same guy $350 to fix a pump.  In February 2016, I received a letter regarding renewal of my Samsung Warranty!!!!!  The one that we had that just expired in Dec. 2015 that nobody had any record of me purchasing.  At that time the 3 yr Warranty cost the same as the Washer which was on sale at the time.  I purchased nothing and did not renew -- low and behold, my dryer sensor is now going out.  Are appliances really only supposed to last 5 years?!?!?  Don't think I will shop at Lowe's or purchase a Samsung product again.  So disappointed. :(\n",
      "Most impressed so far with the \"weight sensor\" feature that automatically adjust water usage based on size of the load. If you are not stacking a dryer on top, highly recommend pedestal because drum opening is very low to the ground compared to a top-loader.Only con so far is the location of the bleach dispenser, which is very small, making it difficult to add bleach without spills into the other compartments.\n",
      "I just have used it for a week and it has been what I expect. Very quiet and clothes/bed sheet/towels washed well.\n",
      "I've owned this washer for 2 days, completed 6 loads of laundry and I'm now sold on a front loader. I have nothing really to compare it to in its field, but so far, I LOVE this washer! It's super quiet and I must say, out of the 5 washers I've owned/used in my life, this is the first one that I've been able to remove the clothes from and noticeably smell the cleanliness! !!!! Front loader all the way. . . From now on!!\n",
      "awesome product. easy to use. Would recommend to a friend\n",
      "Cleans, steams and neutralizes my dirty laundry. I'm left with clean and fresh clothing. Short of ironing my clothes for me this is an amazing washer. It even makes pleasant music when a load is complete.\n",
      "Just had this machine a week or so but this washing machine is very quiet. It is easy to use. Has a lot of good features. It has performed very well, and we are quite pleased with this Samsung washing machine.\n",
      "I bought this washer a year ago and the main panel just started blinking. I called for warranty service and a month later my washer is still not fixed!!! The additional warranty does not work well with Samsung and I will not buy a major appliance again with Lowes!!\n",
      "Great washer, comes with all required accessories (drain hose, c/h water hoses, y-connecter cold water hose for dryer unit. High efficiency, does well even with a cold water wash.\n",
      "make sure you level the machine after a few days of use.\n",
      "Used 3 times - just washed a large comforter; machine was stable. Ive noticed on all loads, there is a bit of standing water at door seal, I did not have this on past machine. Impressively quiet. I have not washed anything soiled yet, or whites.\n",
      "I had white shirts with lots of stains. I used my new machine using the same products i used before in other machines, and now I have my whites back to life.\n",
      "The washer has worked fine, no issues, cleans clothes well. Very quiet for a washer. Many features that I have not used yet.\n",
      "Just received it today. Kenmore front loader died after 13 years, hoping this lasts as long. Has lots of new features that I am excited to try, including a cleaning feature. Easy to get to lint trap located on bottom left front of washer. On second load of laundry today and it is a fairly quiet machine. Beeping when it's done is a little annoying, however, I can hear it downstairs (softly).\n",
      "We love our new wash machine. Love the digital aspect and the very many options for washing. (Ex- bedding)\n",
      "I am so thrilled to have such a wonderful washer machine, there are so many wash options. The stream feature is amazing! ! And now I can finally wash my comforter without having to take it to a dry cleaner.\n",
      "When my washer and dryer were delivered and set up, no one mentioned that as I have wood flooring there may be vibrating and that it could be the adjustments and/ or the flooring. The manual should be clearer on how to adjust the level .\n",
      "I love the way this product looks. It has a lot of different features, and it is quiet. Works great!\n",
      "We are very happy with the performance and value of this washer\n",
      "First time buying Samsung washer love it it works really nice\n",
      "Wanted one of these for so many years.  Finally broke down and got the set.  Dryer works well, but this washer",
      "not so much!  Had it delivered and did one load of laundry.  Five days later I wanted to do another load.  Hit the power button",
      "nothing!!  Hit it again, still nothing.  Hold the power button for a few seconds and still no power.  Walk away and 5 minutes later I hear it.  It turned itself on all by itself!  It must have selective power and goes on when it wants to.  I tried unplugging it and using another outlet, hitting the breaker, still no power.  It is either a bad cord or a bad control board but after not even 1 week of having it???!!!  For a $600 washing machine I expected much more.  I bought this to replace a washer and dryer set that I bought at another appliance store that cost $450 for THE SET and that lasted me 17 years with only 3 repairs in that entire time!  I expected much more at this price and from Samsung.  Lowes is replacing the washer this weekend but I think now I'm buying the extended warranty because I am very scared as to what will happen next.\n",
      "I've only washed 2 loads to make sure it works, but it did a great job of getting the laundry clean. However, in looking for the serial number to register my washer I noticed it has a filter on the bottom front that is supposed to be cleaned every 2 months. I don't know how that will go as the washer fills the entire tray I have it sitting in in case of leaks.\n",
      "For those with limited space like in a New York City apartment this washer gives you all the features and benefits of a full size but with the added benefit that you can stack the dryer on top. Don't forget the stackable brackets to secure the washer and dryer and ensure it does not move during use\n",
      "Great washer and dryer! We are happy to add it to our collection of Samsung products!\n",
      "This machine is quiet while working and instead of an annoying buzz or bullhorn when the load is done is has a musical tune. Also, I really like the choices of spin cycle, the ability to save a favorite cycle and the choice and range of cycles is larger than other machines I looked at. I will enjoy doing laundry in the future with this machine\n",
      "I love my new front load. I have a baseball player and soccer player and it gets the clothes very clean. They also smell very fresh.\n",
      "I love this washer it has a lot of different cycles even one for bedding, also has a button so you can do an extra rinse or spin. The best part is it has a child lock feature so your children can not push the buttons and change your settings. It also tells you the time it will take for it to be done washing. I am very thankful and happy with my purchase.\n",
      "My wife and I have had this machine for a couple of weeks and have had no issues. Whether filling it up all the way or a small load, the machine is quiet, does not rock, and all the clothes come out better looking and cleaner than the top loader we had.\n",
      "Bought this washer less than 18 Months ago and just had to spend almost 600.00 in repair costs. Took almost 3 weeks to get a Samsung authorized repair person to look at it.\n",
      "I just got this washer a few days ago and have been running it non-stop getting caught up on my laundry. So far, it has worked great. I like that I can program my most used settings and then only have to push one button to start the wash.\n",
      "I have only run a couple of loads, but the machine is quiet, efficient and much better than the front load machine it replaces. I have always left the lid (top loaders) or door (front loaders) open or ajar to dissipate moisture. This is an absolute must to avoid mold and mildew.\n",
      "I have never had a front load washer.I was a little reserved to by one as others talked about the moisture that stays in the drum.After talking to the salesman, he recommended propping the door open & leaving the soap tray open a little.I have been doing this and it is working just fine. I put a rolled up wash rag in the top of the door to hold it open.With that being said I love my washer.\n",
      "This is a great washer, quiet and cleans well. the only downside is that the stainless steel color scuffs easily\n",
      "received this washer and started using it. easy to use and silent. Looks durable and has sleek design. I love the steam feature in the cycle. definitely a plus. I heard good reviews on this washer so I purchased one.I will have to comeback after a year using this product to see how it performed throughout one year at least.\n",
      "I PURCHASED A SAMSUNG HIGH-EFFICIENCY FRONT-LOADER WASHER WITH STEAM CYCLE.  THE LETTERING CAME OFF AS I WAS LIGHTLY WIPPING THE CONTROL PANEL WHERE SOME DETERGENT HAD DRIPPED.  I CALLED THE 800 # AND FOUND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO BUY A WHOLE NEW PANEL AT A COST OF $80. THEY DO NOT HAVE A DECAL TO FIX THE PROBLEM. SO NOW I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA IF I AM WASHING WITH COLD, HOT, OR WARM WATER.  ALSO THE LETTERING TO CHOOSE WHAT WASH CYCLE SELECTION IS WEARING OFF.  IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT SAMSUNG WOULD  MAKE A PANEL SO CHEAPLY, AND I DON'T THINK THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY $80.00 TO CORRECT SAMSUNG'S PROBLEM.  I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT AGAIN.\n",
      "This washer met my expectations. Its important to leave the door open after use to avoid sitting water which leads to mold. Overall, it cleans well and has a lot of good features\n",
      "Fit and finish is great. Functionality is intuitive and requires little study of the manual. Very quiet.\n",
      "There is no review to accompany this rating.\n",
      "This washing machine is excellent in power consumption, very quit it reminds you if you done for your washing it beeps. This is my first machine and I like it, so I can recommend to any of my friends.\n",
      "Purchased Samsung companion high-efficiency stackable front load washer and Dyer under three years ago.  Both worked fine for two years, then washer kept blowing codes.   We were able to trip code by draining the washer for a few months.  The drain was clear may I add.  Then it stop turning completely.   Repair came out and dx the problem was code related to timing error.  It took three weeks to get the part.  When he came back, it blew the drain code.  Another two weeks for a part.  When the repair man dismantled the machine, he discovered the drain was totally rusted, the bolts were unremoveable and had to be broken.  The  computer card was cracked for the time related problem.   I am 67 years old with no dependents other than my husband.  Point being, I am not washing a dozen batches of clothes a day.  I am sorry I trusted Samsung.   Waiting for the dryer to blow-up next.\n",
      "I finally changed the washer I got with my house when I bought it and love the performance and efficiency of this washer. It's simple to operate and gives me an exact time of how long it will run.\n",
      "I have had the repair shop work on my washer twice in 2 months .. 1st time leak somewhere in front of machine .. Tech installed new door seal .. ( didn't fix problem ) after tech disassembled machine and put back together the washer is very very loud on spin cycle . Round 2 is to find leak that is occasional and fix noisy spin cycle .. Samsung is sayin if they can't fix it this time then they will replace washer ..  Listen to video on spin cycle\n",
      "I don't know how I washed before. This washer is excellent!\n",
      "Like I said just got them love it so far love color, design. Happy\n",
      "Purchased and have owned for 1 month now. No issues and have used a few of the different features so far. Overall I am pleased with the purchase. I will try to update if I have any issues over the next several years, but I don't anticipate any so far.\n",
      "This is my first front load washer and the first new washer in 15 yrs. Yes, that is how long my old washer lasted! So my review is not one of an expert or experienced washer purchaser. Overall I love it so far. I have had it about a month. Cons that I have noticed which may be with all front load washers:**The door does not open back far enough to be left open in my tiny area, therefore the washer doesn't really get aired out. I always left the lid open on my old washer and never had a problem with odor or mildew, this one concerns me.**We have not been able to get the washer \"leveled\" The level say its level but the washer still sounds like it is going to jump away at some points during the wash/rinse cycle:/**Our clothes seem to have a bad smell if they are left for any amount of time. A load in the old washer could sit for a day before I dried them!**Cold cycles take over an hour to run!**Because it has had to be moved out so many times to unstack and restack the dryer we bought the same day the plastic on the back leg has been damaged:( (1st dryer delivered with huge dent, 2nd controls pushed in, 3rd smoked and had a rattling sound and STILL WAITING on # 4 to come in.)  Pros **Love the cute tune that plays when the load is done**Love that the door has to be closed to start a load and locks after a certain point**CHILD CONTROL LOCKS!**My clothes are clean and it uses less detergent!**Super speed spin means less dry time**Like that it has so many options including quick wash**Love that I can wash my king size comforter in it!!!! It will hold almost twice what my old washer would**I like the steam option but I have only used it once so far**Its actually relaxing to watch it run.....lol**Looks pretty\n",
      "well designed and easy/intuitive to use. quiet and sleek\n",
      "This is the first appliance my wife and I \"splurged\" on (although it was priced amazingly). Oh, what a difference from our old top load! I was scared of it at first being digital controls with so many settings. Turns out, it's crazy easy to operate and I find myself using every cycle. The washer is super quiet and I even like the little tune it does when you shut it off. Before purchase, the salesman was pushing a different manufacturer on us as it has a placement for the door to not be fully closed to \"air out\" the drum and Samsung didn't have that. Well, I can close the door on the Samsung just like he could on the other brand and I have had no musty smell/residual moisture in the Samsung. I know I haven't had this product very long, but I would highly recommend it to everyone. Is my life that sad that I look forward to laundry day now?!\n",
      "I love this washer. It is very easy to use and have great capacity and the clothes come out very clean. The clothes dry better since I have gotten this machine. I love it.\n",
      "Cant believe how little water this thing uses, but it still gets clothes cleaner than my old washer.\n",
      "There are so many options to cleaning. It has a large capacity to wash more.\n",
      "I have only had this unit for one week and already the locking mechanism on the door is either broken or has parts that have come lose. The \"male\" part of the lock is lose, like it hasn't even been tightened down with the screws and I cannot tell if the \"female\" section has issues but bottom line, not a good start and I can't recommend something that tanks after only a week.\n",
      "This product washes well. I have not used the steam feature so I am unable to comment.\n",
      "This washer doesn't vibrate as others of the same kind. It has differents cycles depending on the type of load and it is fast.\n",
      "I have had this Washer for only a few weeks. So far it does an amazing job getting clothes clean. It seems to take longer than my traditional washer, but it depends on the options you choose. It is not on a pedestal and is fairly noisy with the laundry room door open. Sometimes there is water in the drawer that you put your soap in so you have to empty it before adding soap. Still really like it and am happy with my purchase.\n",
      "Still too new to fully evaluate, but the clothes are clean and unit vibrates less than my old Whirlpool.\n",
      "Never have I used a washing machine that works so well so quickly. It has gotten many hats and other items of mine much cleaner than my previous top loading washer, on top of being more efficient. Plus the cycle finish song puts a smile on my face every time it goes off.\n",
      "This is probably the best washer I've owned. It's really quiet and has tons of features.\n",
      "Quiet, holds a lot and it Sanitizes!!!! I love how I can fit king size bedding and it doesn't get damaged!\n",
      "Best washer we have ever owned. It runs virtually silently, has multiple cleaning modes and does a great job.\n",
      "We've never loved this washer, and now officially hate it.  Paid $720 for the appliance and the required cord from Lowe's. Door came with small shards of broken glass in the cracks of the plastic handle, which resulted in stitches for me in the first week.  After 18 mos, the door is broken.  It won't latch properly, so we can't start a wash cycle.  Haven't reached out to Samsung yet, but really dredge the prospect of dealing with getting it fixed.  It's either something broken with the latch or the hinge, since both are made of non-stilurdy plastic.Washes fine if the door closes, but you kind of need both.\n",
      "I love the features its quite and my clothes smell so clean.\n",
      "This is my 1st front end loader. I have used it almost 1 month & have had no trouble getting our clothes clean. Loves how it spins out all the water. Doesn't take hardly any time to dry the clothes - even towels... Very pleased with purchase!! Excellent washer!!\n",
      "I purchased this Washing Machine because my Dad has one and I liked the way it operated. I used his a couple of times because my own WP top load was useless since it continuously became unbalanced as soon as the spin cycle started.  This machine however, balances itself so that was a plus. The fact that it is a front load means that all of the clothes get washed evenly. And since everything is now High Efficiency and less water is used that makes a big difference. Another plus is, there is no agitator to worry about wearing your clothes out prematurely. This machine also has the steam wash feature and it is great. I have had this Washer now for right at a month and I am thoroughly pleased. I work in an Industrial environment (Pulp Mill) so my work clothes get their share of abuse (Dirt, Grime, Grease, Sap, Pitch and various Chemicals also). With just the recommended amount of detergent my clothes are cleaner than they have been since purchased.   I will also be purchasing the matching Dryer unit soon.\n",
      "This washer is wonderful! It's much quieter than my older model which is nice because my laundry room is open to my kitchen. It sets the water temperature itself which is nice and there are many different cycles to choose from for various types of laundry. I've never minded doing laundry in the past but it's going to be even easier now!\n",
      "this product is nothing short of great just like every other samsung product we have ever purchased will buy more any day\n",
      "I love the color and washes clothes better than any washer I have used before.\n",
      "The design and look is what I like most about this product. Plus, the fast that is works amazing is the reason i LOVE it. I would recommend this product. Not to mention the size is perfect for the limited space i have in my apartment.\n",
      "Product cleans well, Offers lots of cycles for a variety of laundry. Still learning about the features.\n",
      "I wasn't to sure if I wanted this kind of washing machine. The sales clerk did such a good job explaining all the features I just couldn't pass it up. I have liked Samsung products for years. Now I am completely sold on this front load washer. It is very quiet and the clothes come out great.\n",
      "Bought this washer after much research, since it was replacing the machine I bought 23 years ago. It's been great! Very easy to use since it came with clear instructions. Clothes look and feel great after washing!\n",
      "Very happy with this washer! We purchased recently and love the way it cleans clothes, is quiet, and has multiple settings!\n",
      "Very happy with how many items it holds and how it spins.\n",
      "Great stackable w/d, it's a little hard to reach clothes in back of washer but had I put the pedestal underneath then I couldn't reach the dryer controls, a little tough as it is im 5'7\". I love the quick wash, only about 26 min total. Love it.\n",
      "The Samsung washer I just bought is wonderful. It has many features to meet my needs. The ability for it to be stacked or positioned side-by-side with the dryer is a plus.\n",
      "Looks really nice and is also pretty quiet. Having trouble with the wi-fi connection but other than that it works well. I do wish the door was reversible however.\n",
      "My washer and dryer is awesome. I love it.........\n",
      "this washer got my clothing cleaner than they have ever been even after just one wash! also the washer is very large witch means less loads! very impressed and pleased!\n",
      "This Samsung washer is excellent! Great features at a reasonable price! I would recommend this washer to others!\n",
      "Moved up from top loader to this and this one sets a bit further from wall and therefore into room...but great product\n",
      "I had no idea a washer could do do much. Purchased it for conserving water, and realized how dirty my clothing was after my previous washer cleaned them sheets oh so soft and smelling fresh, thumbs up to Samsung.\n",
      "I just got my new washer several days ago and have been using it a lot to catch up on my dirty laundry. It has great features and they're easy to use. I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends.\n",
      "This washer is impressive because of its size and its many features. It has separate compartments for powder detergent, liquid detergent, bleach, and fabric softener. It also has a self clean option as well as custom temperature, spin, and soil level settings. It even has a steam option, which I plan on utilizing very soon. It does it all!\n",
      "Love everything about this machine especially the end cycle tune!\n",
      "The machine looks better in person than expected. It has an intuitive dashboard that is simple to use. The front load design makes it easy to load. This is our first Samsung appliance and we will more than likely replace the dryer with Samsung matching model later this year.\n",
      "works great is quiet and cleans great will recommend to others\n",
      "Had it for one day; already knocked out seven loads in no time. Very quit. and washes very well.\n",
      "I love the many features to choose from, for specific clothes types. Nice look,easy to use.only problem is during the spin cycle it shakes a little too much. I could be that it is up on the drawers and do not have a solid base.\n",
      "Works like a champ and very user friendly. I love the steam function and the self clean feature. My wife and I are very happy we chose this washer.\n",
      "Was told this was one of Samsung's best washers, with the new VRT technology which would make it quiet and noise-free. It's actually the noisiest front loading washer I've ever heard. I have it leveled on a tile floor, with all shipping brackets removed. From the moment I started it up to do my first load and ever since then, it squeaks like crazy, and shakes and vibrates very loudly. Can hear it in the livingroom with the laundry room door closed and the tv turned up. When my girlfriend heard it for the first time she was concerned something was wrong. The washer has nice features and is easy to use, but the VRT (vibration reduction technology) is anything but that. I'm very glad I purchased the 5 year warranty because I'm beginning to think it won't last nearly that long. Needless to say, this will be the last Samsung washer I will ever purchase.\n",
      "This is the second Samsung Washer and Dryer I have owned. I recently sold my house with all new Samsung appliances, and missed them so much I just recently purchased another set for where I live now. Not only do they look amazing, I love how these machines work and how easy they are to use. They wash your clothes very well and work quietly. The washer has many features to choose from. One of my favorite features is the steam feature in both the washer and dryer. As an added little bonus, I love the little music it plays when the cycle has ended. One thing I do miss from my original set, is the dryer rack (which seems to be no longer included). I had that in my last Samsung dryer and used it a lot for drying sweaters, sneakers, pretty much anything I didn't want tumbling too hard or getting damaged in the dryer. That's why I gave the features section 4 stars, otherwise it would of been a 5 star rating. Love these machines, I highly recommend them.\n",
      "This devise washes clothes with little water and is extremely quiet. There is no agitator or suds. The cycles, water temp, timers are many and will take a while to learn. Very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "Everything comes out looking fresh and smelling great. Easy on clothes, easy to use, and very very quiet. I love it considering I had to turn my last washer off to use the phone. Highly recommended!\n",
      "I am still learning all the features of this washer, but so far its been great for a variety of uses. One confusion is around using the washer to wash my toddler's shoes. The shoes are labeled as \"machine washable\" but the owners manual of the washer instructs not to do it. Other than that, the capacity is amazing to reduce the number of loads and get laundry done quicker.\n",
      "It's great! So quiet. You can really customize to want you really need. AND it's pretty!\n",
      "I have owned two other front load HE washers, complete with all the \"bells and whistles,\" but by far this new Samsung washer beats the competition by far. There are so many different ways to do wash, that I am just now, after almost four weeks of having it installed, learning how to use all the new washer settings. Would I trade this in or if we were to sell our house, would I leave this behind? Absolutely not! LOVE this washer!!\n",
      "Love all the options. And so easy to use. Love all the features it has.\n",

      "Just bought a set of Whirlpool Washer & Dryer from a friend....they were horrible, Camrio models, ripped up our towels and didnt get dirt off clothes. We are literally throwing them away, would feel guilty to give them away. I had already purchased all new kitchen SamSung Appliances, and very happy with them, so decided to add the washer & dryer. So very happy with purchase. Samsung is getting it right with household appliances.\n",
      "Everything works as expected and has not had any problems yet.\n",
      "This is the worst washer I have ever owned.  Water comes out of the fan on the back.  Repairman that Samsung sent says this is normal if you put too much detergent or fabric softener in or if you don't use HE.  I use Tide HE and if I put any less in, I would not be using any.  Leaks all over the floor periodically.  Worst $900 I ever spent and I own the matching dryer too.  Also bought a Samsung Fridge about the same time.  Last $$ Samsung will get from us.  I have had it 18 months and had 6 service calls all over this leakage.\n",
      "This washer is great! It runs quiet, cleans great, and we purchased at a great price.\n",
      "Very energy efficient, and runs great! Has a lot of great features. Love the color of it, and how quiet it is. I would definitely recommend to a friend!\n",
      "Let me just start by saying I love tools or I should say I love tools that work really well. I will say before I continue my review that I had the original set for 10 weeks until they were replaced by a new set because the other ones were vibrating pretty badly but in my opinion that had a lot to do with the installation. I did two months of research before choosing the twins. And for most of that time I was looking at Toploaders because the reviews said you have to keep the front loaders door open so it dries out. And I have to admit that put me offer a little bit until I realized that I always leave my Toploader washer machine Open after it's finished.My new twins are a dream and are living up to my expectations as to how they should operate when they're working properly. For This review I\"m talking about the washing machine it runs super smooth and quiet. What I didn't really Count on was how much better my clothes would be cleaned. My whole life my experience has only been top loaders so this is my first front loader experience. And I got the pedestals mainly for the storage convenience. And they put them at the perfect height for transferring clothes from one to the other. You'll see in the photo I got a little crazy with the painting of the room so as to give the greatest contrast to the merlot color. I will probably have to tone it down my wife thinks it's a bit much. The washing machine really does spin them so well that the dry time is shorter. And I'm sure everybody can relate to this when we've left them in the dryer and didn't take them out the clothes were a little wrinkly. I just put them through the wrinkle away mode and it worked great. And it is really nice to be able to turn off the notification sounds.\n",
      "I am not happy at all with this machine,it is a HE washer,but it uses hardly no water.Heavy soiled clothes will not come clean.I do feel if there was a way to add more water it would be fine !!!\n",
      "It's a great washer, the only problem is that I have is connecting the washer to the Internet\n",
      "The washer works fine. No complaints about how clean our cloths are. Not happy with noise it is making, Squeeking noise as it begins to spin. I know it is a lubrication problem and not a mechanical malfunction but I still dont want to hear my new washer from the other end of the house. Only other thing that needs improvement is the design. The control panels are set at an angle and for a stacking unit it makes it very difficult to reach the controls on the dryer. My wife needs a step ladder to access them.\n",
      "GREAT WASHER WITH MULTIPLE COMBINATIONS OF WASH AND RINSE. LOVE COLOR\n",
      "We have had our washer for a month or so now and we couldn't be happier with our new washer. It cleans everything completely and has enough features for all types of clothes. With a broad range of ages using this washer it is easy for all of us to get our clothes clean. We plan on getting the matching dryer soon we are so pleased with the features and effectiveness of this washer. It is intuitive and easy to use and program and performs flawlessly and we use it right next to the nursery and it is so quiet that the baby sleeps soundly when the washer is running. That alone is worth it's weight in gold.\n",
      "this new washer machine does good quality washing which is the most important feature for me. It has many technical features but is not intimidating. It is easy to use even if you are not a tech pro. It took only abut 5 minutes to read the instructions and figure out how to use it. Even my Spanish speaking cleaning lady and my teenage son had no problems using it. It is hi efficiency and relatively quiet- always a plus. It looks nice too.\n",
      "very satisfied with product, however the steam dryer did not come with a drying rack...\n",
      "I love my new Samsung washer! It works great on tough stains and is very quiet. The design is slick and increases perceived value of my space! Sometimes I just find myself to visit the laundry room to check out how beautiful my laundry room looks with the new Samsung washer-dryer!\n",
      "I am happy with the washer so far. I hope it lasts longer than my last Samsung washer (6 1/2 years). They don't build appliances like they used to.\n",
      "We are overall pleased with the washer/dryer set. Initially tried to order the platinum color, but they were out of stock. We went with the white, which actually worked much better for the design of the room. Upon ordering, we bought bumper pads/guards as recommended. However delivery said we wouldn't need them. on tiled flooring. they were trying to help save us money, which we appreciated. 2 months later, the washer shakes quite a bit and makes lots of noise. its our only complaint. however, we think this is due to shifting toward the drain in the floor.\n",
      "This is our 2nd Samsung front loading washer and the first lasted 8 years with heavy use and nary a problem until one of the computer boards went bad and continually failed to drain the washer. The problem with such high tech designs and units is that it's darn near impossible to find a technician who understands what's related to what in order to properly fix it. The first tech did nothing more than drain the machine and declared it fixed. Of course, it stopped working with water buildup the next day. The second (different tech) said it was a pump problem and replaced the pump. The problem occurred as soon as he tested it which led him to conclude it was a computer board problem...with someone finally being bright enough to call Samsung. When these units work they work well. When they do not, it's not easy to get a repair done properly, or so it seems. Here is the design problem with this unit. The drain filter clogs or declares it is clogged AND then locks the door and stops the cycle until you manually drain and clean the filter, even if it doesn't need it. It does say on the filter door to clean it every two month. Sure as apples grow on trees, the unit locked up and didn't drain on day 60 of owning it. I've now set an auto reminder on my smart phone calendar to clean the filter whether it needs it or not every 60 days. Good luck!\n",
      "I really love my new Samsung washer. It's energy efficient but still effective.\n",
      "Had this washer almost a year now, and am very very satisfied with it. The sanitize setting is exactly what my fiancé and I needed as she is a professional chef, and I in the animal care field. Both of us come home with who knows what on us, but we are about to put our clothes in the washer and be confident that all the nasties are killed off. No issues with the washer, just purchased the matching dryer last week actually. Very happy with our washer purchase even a year later.\n",
      "This front load washer is just what we needed. Not overly complicated but enough options to do what we want. The price was fairly reasonable compared to other models.\n",
      "I had my old washing machine for 20+ years before it died and it would literally shake the house when it was spinning the clothes. Once it died I went onto the consumer review website and saw that this model was one of the top rated ones. I was looking for a high efficiency and high capacity washer because I live on a farm with 3 girls and the amount of laundry I do in a week is absurd.  I am amazed at this washer. First its so quiet, I don't even know it's working. The variety of washing cycles is awesome and since I live on a farm the steam cycles are great in getting out tough stains. Plus when the clothes are done, they are almost dry which is great and another awesome money saving feature. The color is awesome and an added bonus because it really brightens up the laundry room. I really can't say enough about how great this machine cleans my laundry. I am very confident in my decision.\n",
      "I have to be honest, at first I was a little hesitant with purchasing a front load washer. I honestly didn't think it would get my clothes as clean as a good old fashion top load washer with a agitator, My husband persuaded me to give this Samsung washer a try. I can honestly say that it has surpassed my expectations. It has all the bells and whistles that more expensive washers have but at a more affordable price tag. I am hooked! I actually enjoy washing clothes now and do not look at it as a chore. It gets my clothes cleaned perfectly.\n",
      "Love selection of features and how easy it is to use.\n",
      "I like the steam cleaning option and is so easy to operate. Love my new washing machine.\n",
      "I purchased a similar model just about 2.5 years ago and just past the normal warranty period it failed.  The problem is the last part of ANY cycle.  A 45 minute cycle has ran anywhere from 4 hours to overnight (just testing to see if it would ever stop).  Typically it has ran 2-3 hours on any cycle if it ever stops.  Sometimes it does stop but the clothes are dripping/wringing wet.  It goes through this balancing period of tossing them back and forth which seems like it should then it starts the actual high speed spin to complete the cycle.  Sometimes it barely gets to spinning it it tosses loud as if they are out of balance then starts to toss to balance again.  It is usually in the last 10 minutes of any cycle but as an example it could display 4 mins remaining.  It may finally get to a high speed spin that appears it's finally going to complete the cycle.  Spinning hi speed.  No indication of any imbalance and quietly spinning.  It will suddenly stop spinning slow to zero RPM and immediately add time back to 12-18 minutes then go through this vicious process again.  Samsung support was WORTHLESS.  First time there was no reply and the second attempt is reply with simply pointing to the manual to troubleshoot.  We paid in the $800 range for this washer and it is a worthless pile. We didn't buy just to have a new washer but to replace a good old fashioned washer (which is near impossible to find anymore) that lasted about 15 years and was half the price or less.  I would expect to get the same time or more out of this type of washer but barely got two.  I'm turning away from most of Samsung products of any kind mainly because of their lack of support.  We just purchased a GE dryer to replace one that quit after 20 years of use so I'm hoping for a better experience and therefore a better review of that product.  Bottom line we are DONE with Samsung!\n",
      "I'm so glad I did not listen to all the negative things that my old school family said about front load washers because this washer is the best and i'm not sure how I washed clothes in the past without having one.\n",
      "I have just purchased my washer and used it 3 times. It was very easy to use and I am impressed with how the closed looked after washing.\n",
      "I owned a Whirlpool Duet Sport set and bought it brand new than we had mold and spin and noise issues that we suffered with for almost 5 years than we moved and decided to purchase a new Samsung top load set. We owned it for 6 years and the 5th and 6th year was the worst because it was like it was about to explode. Samsung took it very serious and work very fast and they gave me a refund for the washer. Because my top load washer and dryer was in the platinum color I decided to keep my dryer that went with my old Samsung top loader and buy the platinum front load washer and it matches my dryer. I'm glad I gave a front loader another chance because I'm so happy with this machine except there's a lot more maintenance to go with it but still worth it!!!\n",
      "WE NEEDED TO PURCHASE THE ANTI-VIBRATION ANTI-SKID PADS BECAUSE IT MOVED QUITE A BIT WITH LOADS OF BEDDING IN IT . IT WAS OK ON OTHER LOADS . PERFORMANCE IN CLEANING VERY GOOD\n",
      "Replace old Samsung with this unit. So far we have used it 6 days and all the cloths are so so much cleaner and almost dry so that the matching dryer has hardly any thing to do. Would recommend highly.\n",
      "Had a Samsung washer prior to this one and even though it lasted only 5 years the features out weigh that life of operation. Willing to try another Samsung because of that. We also own a Samsung dryer and dishwasher that are performing very well REJ\n",
      "THIS IS SAME REVIEW I GAVE THE DRYERJust got this installed w/ the dryer washer (DV42H5200), stacked. So far, washing and drying are ood but there are a few things I hadn't considered and you probably should:(1) the ring (which is a little song) is NOT loud enough to hear outside of the laundry room and there's no adjustment feature; it's on or off, period. There IS an app for it that I haven't gotten yet so I'm hoping it will give me a notice when I'm elsewhere in the house. Don't know though.(2)) on the dryer, the timer feature has only 3 settings: 20, 40, or 60 minutes. I'm used to setting whatever time I want along with the temp. Now I'll have to play with only the temp since the times are fixed. Not happy about that. (Haven't done anything special with the washer yet.)(3) DO NOT STACK THIS W/D SET UNLESS YOU ARE 6'6\"!!! I'm 5'7\" and need a fairly tall stool to see the controls! They were straight up on my previous W/D so they were easy to see. On these they're slanted back so you CAN'T see the top one! It's preposterous. Now we're going to have to reconfigure our small laundry room to try to un-stack them, and that's not going to be easy OR desirable .Why still 4 stars? Because the washing and drying are both (otherwise) very good, whereas the previous set was giving us problems. As for items 1-3 above, I wish I had realized these things before buying this set. Don't make the same mistake.\n",
      "I love this washer. It is actually our second one, as we sold our previous one with the house. :-) I use the \"Quick Wash\" feature the most, but appreciate the variety of settings. Some of the other settings are very long, and I like to try to get laundry done more quickly!\n",
      "I purchased this washing machine brand because the manager of the Canandaigua, NY Lowe's Appliance department touted its outstanding qualities in comparison to other front loaders. Unfortunately, after using it for one day, I completely disagreed with the Lowe's manager. A new one was delivered a week later (annoying), but there was no difference, with the exception of the dents that came with the first washer.  The first issue (remains) the 'racking' of the washer when I put it on high spin, which I never do anymore because my whole house vibrates! The high spin is supposed to be a quality of this machine, as it reduces drying time. I went on-line to query what other Samsung washing machine owners have experienced and found that I was not alone with this problem. One Samsung washing machine owner used boat bumpers to stabilize the machine when it was spinning and walking all over the floor. I have done that (on both sides!) and it does help.  When they saw the bumpers, the Lowe's manager and delivery persons agreed that I should not have to do this...duh! By the way, the machine is perfectly balanced (I made sure of that by breaking out my level while the delivery person was at my home). Additionally, the Samsung front loading machine is NOT ergonomically designed, as it is very difficult to remove clothes from the washing barrel.  Finally, the bleach dispenser does not work properly, as it dispenses the bleach undiluted into the washing barrel (completely ruining several items).I caution anyone thinking of purchasing a Samsung front load washing machine 4.2 cu ft high efficiency stack able front-loader washer with steam cycle.\n",
      "Easy to install and operate. Will purchase all over again\n",
      "Just recieved my washer and already in love with it.\n",
      "Just love everything about it!...Washes my clothes perfectly\n",
      "I prefer samsung whaser because it's a good washer ..no problems at all thank you samsumg!\n",
      "We are pleased with the looks, features,all the bells and whistles. Love the low energy cost it will cost to run this washer. It's just an all around great washer.\n",
      "As of now it has been a great washer and dryer. I will keep updating as time goes by. but as of now no problems and it works just as a washer and a dryer should work.\n",
      "I've always wanted a front load washer and I love this washing machine. I can get all my sheets and towels in the same load, and everything comes out smelling clean and fresh. Cleaning the dispensers and gasket is easy. The only drawback is no dispenser for my laundry booster - I have to pour it directly into the basket and then add water. It's not a big deal, but a dispenser would be nice. All in all, I am really glad we bought this.\n",
      "Quiet, fast, very little vibration. The loads go so quickly has helped with all the laundry our 8 kids produce.  Would buy again!!\n",
      "I like the tumble action of a front loader because it doesn't damage my clothes like a top loader.This model looks cool with the platinum.\n",
      "This washer doesn't have all the bells and whistles that the higher end models have, but it's more than capable enough for your everyday laundry needs. It seems well built too.\n",
      "I just bought this washer and dryer and I am so happy to get it, they are quasi quiet and easy to use, definitely I recommend both!!!!\n",
      "I just had it for 2 weeks and I'm so happy with it, I had a regular washing machine for the last 12 years but it was getting old and braking down and then had to put the detergent at the beginning of the cicle and when it started rinsing had to be on the look out cause I need it to put the downy, so with my new samsung I don't have to worry about it cause I put everything together and don't have to worry till is done so I can put it to dry, thank you.\n",
      "We've had the washer and dryer for over a year now and they are complete junk. The washer uses such a small amount of water that clothing barely even gets damp and items have to be washed multiple times on 3-hour long wash cycles just to get the clothes even remotely clean. You can't bleach ANYTHING because there is no soak option. We have to fill up our bathtub with water and bleach and soak whites in the tub prior to washing them in the machine if we actually want the items to look white/clean. Then we have to wash them multiple times just to get the bleach smell out. There are dozens upon dozens of videos online complaining about the very same poor experience with this washer. Only wish I saw them prior to making the purchase. DO. NOT. BUY.\n",
      "Cleans as advertised and is very quiet. First front loader and pleased with the performance.\n",
      "I LOVE IT! I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A WHILE AND I AM EXTREMELY PLEASED WITH ITS PERFORMANCE AND FEATURES .\n",
      "This washer has all the features that we need and truly love the ease of use.\n",
      "It has a very large drum which allows for more water to clean. The controls are easy to use. I like the machine.\n",
      "This washer is extremely quiet. The cycle settings make cleaning different items easy.\n",
      "Immediately proceeding this purchase, we owned a different brand of front load washer. This Samsung is a slick model. It is easy to use and has many steam cycles to choose from. We like the My Cycle that we chose to use as our frequent \"go to\". Our last set was plain white, while this one is silver platinum. It is classy looking and is very quiet. It spins the clothes our to the point where the dryer doesn't take long to do it's work. We priced a lot of machines and this one was a good value during Memorial Day Sale at Best Buy.\n",
      "I just recently purchased this washing machine and am so happy with it! It has so many options and does an amazing job! My clothes feel so much better than they did in the previous washer!\n",
      "First, I'd like to point out that I always do an extensive amount of research when I am looking to purchase a major appliance, looking at price, reliability and value for the money. I'm not usually loyal to a particular brand, but I have to say, all of my recent appliance purchases have ended up being a Samsung product.  Due to my old front loader washer starting to make strange noises, not to mention it would only spin well intermittently, I ended up in the market for a new one. I ended up purchasing this washer for it's features, reliability and value for the money. I have only had it for a couple of days, but so far it is performing much better than my previous front loader. The steam function actually helps clothes come out cleaner. I also like how it seems to sense it is out of balance very quickly, so no loud banging like my previous washer. I found that this washer had the best combination of price, features and value for the money. In fact the closest competitive model was at least $100 more, if not significantly higher than that. As much as I like to say I'm not particular on brand loyalty, Samsung is making a believer out of me.\n",
      "If washer is out of level at all water collects in detergent tray, very annoying!\n",
      "We purchased this washer, the matching dryer, and pedestals six months ago. Everything is working wonderfully but the washer is much louder than I expected it to be. It is louder than our 12+ year old washer that it replaced. The rinse and spin cycles are very loud, to the point where I make sure to not do a load of wash while the baby is sleeping. We have spaced our machines a few inches apart, don't overload them, and have double and triple checked that they are perfectly balanced/level on the ground yet the washer drum bangs very loudly when it spins quickly. We have tried to fix the problem by selecting slower spin speeds, but that decreases the amount of water that is removed which increases drying time. I like the self cleaning feature, but it is also affected by the loud drum issue. It takes four hours to run that cycle so I would like to be able to turn it on before going to bed for the night, but because of the noise we have to try to remember to run it when we will be out of the house for several hours. Luckily, it is only once a month based on our usage (at least one load of laundry per day, 6 days a week). I do love the various cycle options, and that the display tells you exactly how long you have until the load is done. The song that plays at the end of the cycle is also a fun alternative to a loud buzzer. Overall I am pleased, but I wish it were a little quieter.\n",
      "Our last Samsung washer only lasted around 5 years, which is way too short in my opinion, especially for a low usage situation. This machine is very similar, but we needed one that would fit on our existing pedestal. That rather limited what we could purchase. The machine does not have a separate setting for adjusting the temperature of the wash and rinse cycle. It also does not have any adjustment for sound of the 'wash done' signal. It's either loud or off (and it is a long, long signal). Clothes seem to clean ok but the spin cycle still leaves the clothes a little wetter then our old one. Not a big deal really, but I'm sure it adds slightly to the drying time. The color and style is also somewhat different then the model of 5 years ago. Now the dryer and washer do not quite match, but it's not like they are in the living room and get visitors looking at them. Hopefully this one lasts longer then the previous one, or I might rethink the brand as our dryer also has needed several repairs in the 5 year period.\n",
      "Working Great. Better Wash. Good order to get your Landry done.\n",
      "Love this washer. It is quiet. Has so many washing features. We are really happy this is the washer we decided to purchase. We shopped around for a few month before making our decision.\n",
      "This machine is a work horse. Love the color as well as the cute little song it plays at the end of the cycle. Clothes come out very clean and I have no complaints.\n",
      "This is a great washer! I have saltwater fish tanks in my home and the filter socks that we use to filter the water carry all sorts of decomposing material in them as they clean the water. I am able to fully clean and sanitize these filter socks without using any laundry soap or other harsh chemicals that you don't want to put into your fish tanks. I also have kids, and am able to clean/sanitize the bed sheets and their clothes without having to run two different cycles to remove smells\n",

      "Love it! Love it! It is easy to use and does a great job.\n",
      "I am quite happy with this washer and am a big fan of front-loaders. I had one in a previous house. They have fancier and larger machines, but as a single person, this works perfectly for me. It is quiet, has the cycles I need, and I feel the clothes are clean and it is gentle on them (and they get pretty dry after a fast spin). It does a good job of managing unbalanced loads. Through a process of slowing and speeding up, it seems to get the load balanced so it can move up to the faster spin. I opted for the steam version as it did not cost that much more. I've only used it a few times and can't really comment on how effective it is.  I'm hard of hearing, so the silly music that plays when it finishes is pretty worthless for me. It has a \"my cycle\" that lets me tailor a set of common wash options. That's nice, but I wish it would just remember individual things like a second rinse that I always use on every cycle. I did have a circuit board self destruct, but Samsung service promptly responded and repaired the board and got everything working again.\n",

      "I have only had this washer for a few months, but it seems to be going well. I watched the first few loads go through sure that it would not get clean. There is little water usage so I wasn't sure that it could possibly get everything clean. I am not doing the full load that I had been doing with my top loader, but slowly building up to see what happens. We did have a horrible plastic smell in the first few loads that made the clothes unwearable because they smelled so bad. We tried bleach, soap, super hot cycles and nothing could get it out. I ended up using a Tide washer cleaner soap and that got it out. Its been about a month and it hasn't come back. So far so good!\n",

      "We purchased the front-load Samsung Washer & Dryer combination on May 3, 2016. Both products are well-designed with many nice features, ergonomically fit and energy efficient. The platinum color provides an aesthetic high tech look and feel. The washer runs very quiet and performs well on the various loads of laundry (clothes, sheets, comforters and rugs). The washer does not use a lot of water as compared to our previous top load washer. The compartment for laundry detergent, fabric softener and bleach is a nice feature. You can save your laundry wash settings and push a button to future loads.\n",
      "great capacity 1 load an am done very high tech dessign\n",
      "I spend too much time leveling it . even though it shows that it's level it still vibrate when starting to spin.\n",
      "Only had installed for a couple of days, but has worked very well. It is extremely quiet and seems to wash better than previous washer. Design placement of sensor panel is not good, as you can easily hit a control when leaning down loading/unloading and steadying against machine.\n",
      "You can wash from the largest load to just a few items uses very little water and gets the laundry very clean. It is in my kitchen so quiet you can be in the room talk on the phone or have a conversation. Has every setting you could possibly want.\n",
      "I like it allot it has really nice display and it takes good care of my clothes and it helps with the allergys\n",
      "Awesome!!! l LOVE IT! Easy to install, had every option I needed. I would buy more appliances from Samsung.\n",
      "I bought this HE washer after my old one died. This washer has a big barrel and should be able to washer a lot of clothes in one load. We tried to do this. The clothes come out and most of them are not even wet. and some a dripping wet, in the same load. I now only put a third of a load on at a time. What is the point of having a large barrel, when you have to only put in 1/3 of a load and wash it three times. My cloths come out smelly and dirty! I have to rewash everything! This is the worst washer I have ever had. Instead of making your washer so WATER friendly. Make them actually work! Also the cycles are extra long an hour and a half for \"heavy duty\", but even on the longest cycle, with hot water and on the \"heavy duty\" AND \"heavy soil\" cycles the clothes are not washed well. If I have to wash less cloths two and three cloths times, how is that being water, energy and time efficient? Also the self clean cycle is 4 hours. The time is not mentioned anywhere in the manuel. Make sure you do self clean over night, not during a busy wash day!!\n",
      "This washing machine is easy to use and it does a great job washing clothes and other fabrics. BUT it has a flaw that is very annoying. Whenever it goes into the spin cycle it vibrates so much that it causes the washer to move (it walks). It walks faster than my 97 year old grandmother. We bought it from an authorized Samsung reseller and paid for installation. The reseller had their installation expert come over twice to try to fix it. He made sure that it was level and inspected it thoroughly. The expert suggested placing rubber around the washer's stands to secure it. That is unacceptable but what can we do? We placed rubber molding around each stand and it does reduce the amount of walking, but I don't think that's acceptable, considering the washer's high cost.\n",
      "Love the new steam washer. The digital display is easy to follow... no guidebook needed\n",
      "I have had my washer for one week and have to review it to be entered into a contest, lol. I bought it because I loved it! First time owning front loading machines so I'm still enamored. The steam feature has me so in love with it. If I find trouble in any way, I'm coming back and editing this post! :) I did think the tub was going to be bigger.\n",
      "I previously had a ******* washer. If I had had a Samsung when my kids were home, it would have taken me ALL DAY to do a load of laundry. I use \"Extra Spin\" and still the clothes are so wet when the cycle is complete. I've tried different cycles to no avail. The dryer takes FOREVER to dry the clothes (and I do not overload the dryer), but I think it's mostly because the clothes are still so wet when they're taken out of the washer.\n",
      "We've had this washer for almost a month and so far been very pleased. Spins very fast leaving cloths nearly dry.\n",
      "I have never had a new washier or dryer. The have always been used or hand me downs. My wife and I decided enough was enough and went to purchase a new set. We ran into the Samsung 5200 series and the sale was awesome. I was able to get the Platinum colored ones, something i always wanted to do. Every feature fits our way of life. I actually ran the 1st loads of laundry. My biggest test was the King size down comforter.... the set clean it right up. The final test was my gym cloths that had been in my bag for a week...phew! when after using the sterilize mode clothes came out smelling wonderful. This is why I give the set 5 stars.\n",
      "This dryer has been great, very quiet and efficient. I especially have enjoyed the steam and sanitize features. Very pleased overall.\n",
      "This product is a great investment. I have had the matching set with the pedestals and they are just amazing. I love the way the washing machine washes so fast and it can wash very large loads. The only issue I have with them is that they have some wobble in them with the pedestals on them. It is perfectly level on all sides with a level and it tends to be not balanced but it is level. Other then that i love them and would recommend them to anyone.\n",
      "I switched out from my top loader HE because there just did not seem to be enough water in it. With this drum design the cleaning quality is excellent for the money.\n",
      "I previously had a front load by another company it was loud, clothes did not rinse well The Samsung product is quite, easy to use, I love it and I would recommend it to anyone......\n",
      "This machine has a large capacity and even when fully loaded the wash is sparkling clean.Simple to use and looks real sharp\n",
      "I have them on Pedestals and they look gorgeous and BIG!\n",
      "the washer does exactly what it is suppose to do as advertised. Very satisfied with the washer many feature that I love and cleans very well.\n",
      "I really like my new washer. Set up as quick and easy. Liking the new color, style, and settings.\n",
      "Clothes get very tangled during wash cycle and are very wrinkled.\n",
      "For those looking to buy a good quality washer with killing your bank account, it gets your clothes clean. Very easy to use and set up. I bought it because it is a brand I trust and I know will work for many years to come.\n",
      "This washer is the best . Supper,Works great.easy to use\n",
      "Was skeptical of front load washers in general after reading reviews. So far not disappointed. Noise level low (compared to my old top loader). Items come out clean and fresh smelling.\n",
      "I'm an \"old school\" kind of person that normally likes top load washers. This thing is MUCH better than a top load and SUPER quiet to boot.\n",
      "So far...so good! This is a new set. I have only washed one load.\n",
      "This is the best washing machine I ever bought; it is awesome. Washes clothes very clean.\n",
      "This Samsung washer has surpassed every expectations that we had. It cleans very thoroughly and leaves clothes smelling nice and fresh. We really love the features that are built into the machine like; sanitize, allergen, and quick wash cycles. The steam cycle is very good if you have very dirty clothing that the stains will just not come out, and this option can and will take out those pesky stains from your precious clothing. We chose to buy this washer over the reviews of having a five star rating pretty much everywhere on the internet!. We also chose Samsung because of the J.D. Power and associates best customer satisfaction rating of any other wash brand. You will definitely NOT be disappointed in buying these pairs!!.\n",
      "I am liking my new washer and dryer. I had a top loading HE and it was so loud and really rough on the clothes.\n",
      "Have been using it for one week and it's working fine . NFD function inclusion could have been better.\n",
      "Love my new washer. It is a great value and can do a lot of different cycles!\n",
      "Really quiet and can hardly tell it is on spin cycle. Has really useful features and I like the quick wash cycle.\n",
      "Love my washes looks so nice in my new house. Love everything about it!\n",
      "Very luxurious look. Only thing I didn't like about it, I can't swap the door to open from the left side. My contractor already placed the dryer on left side of washer. Therefore the dryer's pipes length are set and can't swap dryer to the right side of washer. I was able to reinstall the dryer's door to open from the left side. But the washer doesn't allow you to reinstall the door to open from the right store. Therefore, I can't toss my clothes from washer to dryer directly. I have to bend up and down to take the clothes out of washer and lift above the door to toss it into the dryer.\n",
      "I just received my new washer and dryer, along with the pedestals today. I have run a couple loads, and they work perfectly. They run quietly, quickly and they are beautiful! I designed my laundry room last summer, right down to the wallpaper and paint, to match this set. I absolutely love them!\n",
      "Is a great washer with steam make everything much easier\n",
      "It really good for house with 3 or 4 people in house. All features are very useful .I like the product would recommend the product to all my friends\n",
      "bought this after i bought a top load whirlpool carbio which i had only two weeks because it wouldnt wash clean clothes traded it back at lowes for the samsung which nwas on sale fore the same price have only had it for a week but it will clean my dirty clothes great looking with many features so far so good!        l\n",
      "Does a great job cleaning dirty clothes. The spin cycle is quieter than my old top loader.\n",
      "I've always wanted this color. This is my second front load washer and if at all possible would not go back to the top load. This color is beautiful, easy to use and my goodness, the clothes are almost dry when the cycle is complete. The value is great, less water and detergent without having to give up my clothes being so clean. Quiet and the steam is phenomenal. Also the music it plays when the cycles are complete is so much better than the \"alarm\" that scares you to death. Highly recommend.\n",
      "My only complaint and bewilderment is why the app that would allow the wifi functionality to operate has still not been corrected. That is one reason I purchased this series, and I am unhappy to note that it is not yet functional. Smart Care: not very smart.\n",
      "We purchased this unit on March 27, 2015. We have had (3) electronic failures in the unit making the unit unusable. We have had (3) service calls to Samsung for the same repair. Samsung keeps giving us the runaround.  I would steer clear of this product, and others like it.\n",
      "Very quiet and the digital display is nice for knowing how long until your clothes are done. A ton of options.\n",
      "This washer was a match to my dryer. The machine has a beautiful slick look. The features are very easy to use. The washer is very quiet during the wash and cycles and surprisingly quiet even during the spin cycle which makes me very happy. The clothes come out clean so it gets the job done. This product is made to use only liquid detergent so you are limited that way. If you have to have the washer stacked, you might need a step stool or ladder depending on your height. One other thing I noticed is that the inside of the washer stinks the next day or the next time I opened it. None the lass, It is a great product and I love it.\n",
      "I love this washer machine. It washes fast and saves on water.\n",
      "We purchased this washer and the matching dryer. They are beautiful and full of features. Our previous washer was 3.5 cu, so this 4.2 is a big step up regarding size of loads. We can wash all our king size bed clothes in 1 load! The dryer also huge, dries the load in record time. We added the pedestals and we couldn't be happier with them because we no longer have the back pain from bending down to do laundry with our old washer/dryer.\n",
      "Just had the washer delivered and did the first load. Happy with it so far...\n",
      "Got the advice from my parents to get a samsung washer and itsee great. Clothes come out super clean!\n",
      "We bought the washer and dryer combo a few years back. I have replaced the heating element in the dryer along with the belt. To this day it still does not dry our clothes all the way without having to start it over a good 3 times! The washer always has different letters on the front for Now flow or any other problem that goes with it I have replace FOUR parts on it. I had a tech come out 3 times within the first 6 months of buying the set! I will never buy another Samsung appliance again! I have spent so much money on this dang thing because it was the right color and I thought the front loads were better, Now I don't even want to buy another front load Samsung has completely ruined them for me!\n",
      "i just received my dryer and washer the other day and i love them.\n",
      "We had a house fire and had to replace our washer and dryer .Insurance did not give us that much, however my wife and I were tired of cheap washer and dryers that cleaned and dried sure but they used too much water and too much electricity. These are the top of the line! Meaning they are the BEST and they are for a reason. It uses much less water, our water bill went down $30 a month, and our electricity bill showed less as well. They have the highest energy saving of all washers and dryers. They are a bit more in cost but it is one of those things, you pay for what you get. We would recommend this to anyone.\n",
      "I purchased this machine last Sunday on 4/10/16 which was delivered today - 4/12/16. Since my earlier washer stopped working I had a huge load of clothes which the in the new machine I was able to load in one go. The machine took very little detergent, and on heavy load ran for about 2 hours to give me the best cleaned clothes ever. This by far is the best and very easy to use, silent washing machine I have ever used.\n",
      "We replaced our old front load washer and overall this is nice.It washes well and is quiet. My concerns:1. Upon spin completion it should rotate back and fourth a few more times to release the items from the drum. Unfortunately it does not and I have to reach around to pull some items off the drum, or manually spin the drum to find them.2. The modifiers are limited. Our old front loader allowed unlimited temperature and spin speed settings. Certain cycles on this machine limit the options.These are all firmware issues that should be re-programmable.Otherwise a good machine.  I only gave three stars for value as I think the buy up price over white is a bit over the top. Maybe $100.00 would be reasonable. Not $200 +\n",
      "So disappointed! One year in I regret this purchase.- This washer does not have a soak setting. The only thing you can do is adjust the soil level. Sometimes that is just not enough!- It uses too little water. Sometimes the bedding has dry spots when I pull it out. - I have never had to iron/steam so much. Leaves items super wrinkled. Overall it does not clean very well. I constantly have to use stain remover. Never had that happen before.I wish I would have not just picked it because it came in red. I should have paid more attention to the features.\n",
      "This machine is so quiet, so versatile and really gets the job done when cleaning clothes. I find myself watching it work sometimes :)!\n",
      "Washer is efficient and gets the clothes clean. We are extremely happy with the washer.\n",
      "I love having this set. I have waited for 40 years to be able to have one! I could sit and watch it like a TV set! It works like a charm. Love it love it love it!\n",
      "This was a great purchase and am very satisfied. This is so much quieter than my old whirlpool duet and the laundry that comes out is much dryer.\n",
      "First time user ... Good Product.... Let's see....\n",
      "Regular home user with 2 kids. My last washer lasted 17 years. I usually never buy a extended protection plan. But for some reason I did get the plan. IT IS A GOOD THING I DID. This has been down more than once. Each time, it was fixed under the plan. BUT, it takes a week to get the repair man over, and then 2 to 3 weeks for the parts, if available (one time they were back-ordered, but I could find them online although they would not use those for the repair --NIB), and then another 2 to 3 weeks for the actual repair to be done. This cost me $90 a week to take my laundry to a local laundromat. So the overall cost on the third breakdown, I could have got a new washer that would not break as often. Look elsewhere. AVOID SAMSUNG. If you have to have it, get the longest protection available!\n",
      "The design on the unit of the display is at an angle. If you stack them, it is really difficult to see the display unless you are really tall. I'm 5 8 and can't see it. I had LG at my last home and their display is straight and can be seen.\n",
      "This is my first front loading washer and I love that the dials are up front, clearly marked and lights up at various stages. Also, the drawer for adding soaps and other additives is located conveniently and easy to use and clean.\n",
      "Absolutely love this product. So happy we bought this washer with the added steam cycle. Love love love!!\n",
      "We had to purchase this model after our previous Samsung stopped working after 12 years. Love the new design. Touch screen is so much nicer than previous turn dials. Washer cleans in less time.\n",
      "Using Tide/Kirkland HE detergents, softener and bounce for drying my clothes, but it still smells bad like washing clothes with water only and let it sit in the washer for a couple days before drying it. I understand it's high efficiency in using less water and detergents, but if it does not make our clothes smell good like the washer without HE, then it's definitely not good to spend more money for it. Regardless how much detergents I used or the clothes level in the basket or washing modes, I have never seen water in the basket except while doing Sanitary/Self Clean modes while the non-HE washer always has about half of the basket. Sometimes, some of the clothes barely gets wet after washing and sometimes the clothe had detergent stains on it and I had to put it in a bucket of water to hand-wash it. I also see 0% detergent foams in the basket while the none HE washer has tones of foams depending how much detergents you use. I did \"Sanitary/Self Clean\" modes with bleach/vinegar every month and still not resolve the issue. I'm a very disappointed customer!\n",
      "Great Washer with many cycles with steam and VRT which works great in keeping noise low when spinning out, can do laundry while kids sleep.\n",
      "This is a great washer, with great features and is so quiet! Our laundry area is down the hall in an alcove. Besides all the features that let you do a great job on your laundry, it is so quiet while running that you barely notice it while watching your Samsung TV!\n",
      "Great Product very happy with it, very efficient, no issues to speak of.\n",
      "The build quality is nice. It's also very quiet, even during spin cycle.\n",
      "Options for every type of wash. Great efficiency. Shakes a bit on the spin cycles, but nothing to major. It corrects itself. Love my new washer.\n",
      "Its a great and i use it all the time great product to buy no if and about it\n",
      "Very satisfied with our appliance; quiet operation, ample choices for best wash cycle suitable for the load on hand, excellent vibration reduction feature to handle large and unbalanced loads.\n",
      "If you don't mind drying the washer after using it then I highly recommend this product. Before I bought this washer I had a front load washer that didn't spin as well as this one did. Now my clothes dry faster and I am finished with laundry sooner.\n",
      "All the options seem very intimidating at first, however everything is designed to be very intuitive. It took about 15 mins to thoroughly read the guide, and then we were up and running. The only thing that didn't work as easily as expected was the wifi mode to notify me via the phone when loads are done. However, that's a small inconvenience considerig all of the great cleaning modes (sanitizing mode you are amazing) that i got in return. One more thing, it looks terrific\n",
      "One thing we noticed quickly is how much noise reduction there was over our former washer. Wash time is very quick also.\n",
      "Dryer works great and looks awesome! Cant say enough good things about this product!\n",
      "Best washer ever fast and minimum noise. Very fast to wash and controls feel good. Good display\n",
      "We did a lot of research on washer and dryer sets. Samsung has only been in the business making washer/dryer sets for a few years. We thought since we love our Samsung TV, that they would make good W/D sets too. Not the case. First we did tell our salesperson that it would be going in our Kitchen so it needed to look nice, be a certain size, and be quiet. We had them installed and first wash just about walked and knocked across our kitchen floor. We made sure was level and put pads underneath. Still was extremely noisey and wobbled all the way through the wash. This wouldn't make a difference if it was downstairs but it's not. It seemed like it had a hard time in the spin cycle. The dryer did not dry your clothes all the way no matter how long or what cycle you had it in. It had a loud vibration when IT was running. They also were much bigger in depth then what it says. We decided to reselect another W/D. We now have a Whirlpool and couldn't be happier. Looks fabulous, so much quieter, clothes get dry, and smaller in depth. Very happy now.\n",
      "Easy to use. Many options for the wash cycle. Clothes come out much cleaner than my old top loader. Love it.\n",
      "huge capacity, cleans really well and looks amazing\n",
      "Everything I was looking for. It is so helpful. I just love it.\n",
      "Just recently got this product and I am IN LOVE. It is very quiet, has child safety locks and is very energy efficient. Love that there is a steam option. My husband is in the military and it is a wrinkle-free life saver. Highly recommend.\n",
      "My first load of towels fluffed up and smelled like a new washer! We both sat and watched the 1st load. So fun to make sure it worked. Our 1st front loader and happy so far. Did a load of delicates just to try another cycle! Didn't think about it sticking out so far into the doorway area.\n",
      "We absolutely love our new washer. It is truly the most advanced and beautiful appliance we have ever owned. We love all the different settings you can use to really dial in the perfect wash. Steam settings clean clothes beyond clean.\n",
      "We got this washer last month and love it! It is so fast super quiet and the clothes come out practically dry already. Which makes the dryer go super fast. Love the little song it plays at the end of the load too. It gets stuck in my head sometimes and I hum it to my newborn.\n",
      "Great product, great color. Looks good against the green room.\n",
      "This is the best washer I have ever used! Very quiet and washes extremely well.\n",
      "Very satisfied! This washer has a high Consumer Reports rating!\n",
      "The Product has all the features required for washing for a single family home. Has great feature for the write price.\n",
      "I always have faith in Samsung products which is why I went with this brand. It's what I would expect out of a Samsung washer, works great! The only thing I don't like is the dial to select the wash cycle. but that's a minor thing.\n",
      "so far very pleased with this washer first time owning a front loader easy to use cleans very well and is quite.\n",
      "Very happy with our new Samsung washer. Quiet and a huge capacity.\n",
      "No disappointment here,great washer,energy and water saver\n",
      "Washer machine vibrates on spin cycle. all drum stationary bolts were removed (3), machine level and calibrated\n",
      "This washer is my first front-end loader and I love it. The controls were easy to figure out, it cleans great, and it's quiet. I have horses and dogs, so that laundry is for sure heavy duty.\n",
      "So far so good.Quiet,great color.Hopefully will last a long time\n",
      "I have owned & used this machine over a year now. I don't trust reviews written by those who have owned a product for only a short time, especially one that takes time to learn and for faults to show, like a washing machine! Please, don't write a reviews until you have really had a chance to use a product and wait until the \"glow\" (or a bad initial experience) wears off.  With that said, overall this has been a very good washing machine. There are tons of features and I have used most. This should please almost anyone. Modest price, but features that are on more expensive units. The capacity is great. The controls are easy to figure out. We have allergy issues so the \"allergen\" cycle is great for that A few reviewers have complained about a \"smell\"...I always leave the door open at least an hour or two after a wash load is emptied. When I do that, I have no issue. There is a drum cleaning cycle and used it once. But I have found there is little odor if I air it out. The drum itself is still spotless today! For the most part, I use detergent paks, and have no issues with clothes not coming out fresh and clean. I have found the liquid fabric softener dish seems to clog, but I rarely use that, and the detergent dish has no clogging problem when I have used it.. The machine is quiet and I have seen NO EVIDENCE that the labels wear out or come off!  The built quality seems good, and have had no external wear at all..still looks new. And I downloaded the \"app\" which diagnoses problem codes: never used it, so deleted it! I have NEVER had a load stop, become un-balanced or not finish for any reason! That was one of the biggest complaints I read about regarding HE Washers in general, but I have had absolutely NO ISSUES like that, with this machine. The only \"con\" I can think of, is the height of the machine. As a 6'3\" person, it can be a challenge to get the laundry out of this front loading machine. I did not purchase a stand, and if I had, that would have taken care of that!\n",
      "I have already washed several loads and it works so well! The cycle selections are great and washing a variety of items is a breeze!\n",
      "This unit has lots of great features, is quiet. On high spin speed it tends to jump around so we have had to limit the spin speed to medium. The medium speed does seem to get the water out.\n",
      "I'm happy with my new washer. Great washer and very easy to use. This machine uses less water than any we've seen. Also have the matching dryer.\n",
      "I love the vaccine threat it can sync with your phone for troubleshooting.\n",
      "It has what I call \"Super spin\" when finishing! Clothes were almost dry when done which me shorter dryer times and less energy used. Only problem is on the spin cycle it almost \"walked\" out of storage area. Will have to figure out how to prevent this.. Lots of options including a steam cycle. This front end loader makes it much easier since I am in a when chair..Most of the products in my Apt. now are Samsung!\n",
      "Great value, user friendly, wonderful product, the only problem is that the web site freezes during registration.\n",
      "Great price, nice features, and hopefully durable for the long term.\n",
      "The washer does what it needs to do. It may have long cycles but they're purposeful. It takes the right detergent and the correct cycle to clean your clothes. It's only a machine: garbage in = garbage out. I like having it thus far. No let downs other than the App that doesn't. Doesn't get connected; perform; do anything! Ummm NO. It doesn't. Worthless claim. It cleans clothes though. Freshest they've been in ages.\n",
      "A really powerful machine- gets clothes clean- alot of features but not too many. really happy with it.\n",
      "Very quiet and runs smoothly. Love all the extra features. Time will tell.\n",
      "First major home purchase and works great!!! Samsung rocks!!!\n",
      "Cleans clothes good some of the selection ( steam wash ) are very long but that may be normal never had that option before.\n",
      "I haven't had this washer for very long, but love it so far. Great on water usage, cleans well, looks good. Haven't used the steam function yet...probably won't use it much. I spin on low and seems to be sufficient. Otherwise its super loud. Huge capacity. Happy thus far.\n",
      "I absolutely love this!!!! I wanted to wait few weeks before doing my review to properly test the item. And all I can say is WOW!it makes NO NOISE! The only sound I hear is the clothes inside moving around. The machine itself is silent! It cleans thoroughly using minimal water! And I love the steam feature! And the color is gorgeous!\n",
      "Great. I use my washer just one month but everything work great\n",
      "efficient and priced competitively with other high end washersa little noisy but better than old Whirlpool\n",
      "This washer is perfect, so quiet so intelligent, recommend 100%\n",
      "Just bought it and hooked it up! All the instructions were easy to follow! Put my first load in and couldnt be more happy. Worked great, is quiet, cleaned good and saves a lot more water then my old washer!\n",
      "So far this washer as worked great. My laundry seems cleaner.\n",
      "Very quite during wash cycle. Clothes get clean and smell great after washing.\n",
      "This is my second Samsung washing machine that we have purchased and it is even quieter that the first one we bought for my inlaws.\n",
      "Love this new machine! It's such an upgrade! The options are endless!\n",
      "So far I am loving my new washer. Was scared to get a front loader but I am glad I did. I have not stopped washing clothes since it was delivered. My clothes come out so clean and smell great. Love the chime that lets me know when my load is complete and also the display that shows how long the load is going to take.\n",
      "Love my new Samsung front load washer/dryer set! Very quiet and cleans clothes well. Dryer is very efficient! Platinum color is awesome and beautiful!! ( I had been looking at these for over 6 months, Wish I had purchased sooner!)\n",
      "I recently purchased the Samsung washer and so far I'm not disappointed. It is very quiet and easy to operate, love the chime at the end of the cycle. The laundry comes clean, but even with the extra spin it is still too wet.\n",
      "This is a great product... Samsung has included high end features for a very reasonable price... I have a great experience using this machine with zero complaints for far...\n",
      "I read a lot of reviews when searching for a new washer and dryer and decided on the Smasung. So far this washer has been awesome with the exception of heavy vibration and bouncing at the beginning of the spin cycle which settles once it gets into its full spin. I have leveled and re leveled it over and over and cannot get this to go away. Other than that it has plenty of room for large loads and gets everything clean the first time. I just wish that I knew what to do about the initial vibration. I wonder if it could have something to do with the base. I have posted a link to a video of this below.\n",
      "We have finally made a wise purchase. We have had our washer and dryer for about a month now and absolutely love them! We had Frigidaire Infinities and they were the worst!\n",
      "My old washer was looking pretty bad..........this is like purchasing a beautiful piece of furniture\n",
      "There is no review to accompany this rating.\n",
      "I purchased this unit a week ago and so far it has done an excellent job. The quietness of this model is superb. It's the quietest washing machine I have ever heard and does an excellent job cleaning, especially whites on the sanitize function. I would highly recommend this product.\n",
      "This washer has made my bedding, towels and clothes amazingly clean! Everything takes quite a beating with my husband being military, a child with urinary medical issues and a puppy that is in the process of being house trained. The settings allow me to choose what would best fit the load and get it cleaned the right way. I absolutely love this washer!\n",
      "Works very well and is very quite. Love the color. Our clothes come out very clean\n",
      "It works great and is easy to operate and is quite. I love it.\n",
      "I need to call the installers back out because the washer vibrates when spinning. The front load washer has it over the top loader; it is easier to see just how much you are putting in. This makes it much easier not too over load. The washer is always showed with the draw but be careful, it comes with a high price tag.\n",
      "So far so good. Easy to use. Happy with this purchase.\n",
      "This Front Load Washer does ALL the work for me AND it is QUIET !\n",
      "I love this new washer. I can't believe how clean my clothes can really be. Also what use to be 2 loads of laundry is now 1; saves me so much time & money.\n",
      "Nice washer, no issues, fairly easy to use. Can't lean over display or it will cut off\n",
      "We haven't had this product long, but it has been good so far. It is quiet, big, and seems to be efficient. The door isn't as sturdy as I thought it would be, but is an overall great product so far.\n",
      "My last washer lasted 11 years. So I went on the hunt for a new washer. There were so many out there I needed to narrow the feel. So I turned to the Internet. I asked for the top ten washers and Samsung was high on several list. I have several Samsung products and have had great service. When I saw the Samsung washer compared to the others I did not hesitate.\n",
      "The washer is silent and works perfect! Huge capacity.\n",
      "This products has great features and is easy to use.\n",
      "Our previous washer was making sounds we never heard and thought \"it's getting ready to go out on us\" so we decided to buy another one. Only this time we got a front loader and couldn't be more satisfied. it gets cloths, linens & towels super clean and the spin cycle almost eliminates drying time. Samsung products are very good quality and our next dryer will be a Samsung Guaranteed.\n",
      "We love this washer and dryer combination! The ease of use and functionality of the washer and dryer are amazing. We love the design and the ease of use. It is awesome how we can customize the cycles and even save our favorite wash and dry cycles.\n",
      "Especially steam option. Also ease of use of all controls.\n",
      "the soap dispenser keeps water in it-it does not always drain. tech can't fix. I live in high humidity and the plastic dispenser (where you put soap, bleach, fabric softner) always molds and so does the rubber seal. it is impossible to keep clean. I would not purchase again in an area of high humidity. also, a hand wash feature would be nice.\n",
      "This washer was easy to install, easy to use and we love the features! Especially the child lock! We did some serious searching before deciding to buy our new washer and dryer & couldn't be happier with our choice!\n",
      "This washer was a replacement for our old Maytag. After just a few uses we are wondering why didn't buy this sooner. The steam/sanitize features are a great addition that we didn't have previously. Compared to our old machine this washer is extremely quite. When the spin cycle on this machine is done the clothes are almost dry already so our dryer times are greatly reduced saving us more money there as well. Another nice feature is that it plays a short tune when it is done (about 10 seconds but can be disabled).\n",
      "This machine has all of the options one needs. It does a great job cleaning and is relatively quiet. Would recommend purchase.\n",
      "Overall this machine works great however; even after having balanced the unit on the pedestal it still wobbles at low speeds. The humming noise it makes when drawing water out of the unit is a little unsettling too. At less than two weeks old I question if these are noises it should be making.But again, it does the job it was purchased for. It cleans the cloths well, looks great and doesn't sound like it's trying to run away when it's spinning.\n",
      "Washing Machine is very quiet and works great...low on water and energy. .i love the product!\n",
      "The performance of the washer is great. Excellent cleaning capability. Quick cycles and spins the clothes dry which reduces drying time. It's nice to be able to select a no spin cycle to wash sneakers and other items. Would definitely purchase again.\n",
      "Just purchased this washer for a very good price and was excited when it arrived, very impressed with the color and chrome. A nice feature on this dryer is that during spin it will rebalance itself so its never excessively noisy.\n",
      "We really like this new washer. It uses less water and detergent and has more features that our old washer. We purchased the pedestals for washer and dryer to make loading and unloading easier.My wife just loves this new washer.Definitely would recommend this to anyone.\n",
      "I love my new washer. Its amazing it functions very well. So glad we chose this one, and its easy to use to top it off. Not to minchion the deal we got on it. Over all a very happy customer.\n",
      "Great value! I can not wait to use the steam cycle. It has a nice appearance especially the digital panel.\n",
      "I love the color, I love the style, I love how fast it is, I love that it sings you a little tune when its done and when it turns on. Its amazing!!!!\n",
      "After reading a million reviews of multiple front load washer sand dryers, I opted for the model based on my past experience with Samsung. I'm not sure how often I'll actually use the steam feature but it's there if I need it. I'm extremely happy with the performance and they're actually a lot quieter than my old top load was. I'm glad that I went for the bases, though. It's made it really easy to load and unload items. I don't think anyone would go wrong with this model.\n",
      "Easy to program/use. Holds a lot of dirty laundry! Spin cycle removes a lot of water so the clothes aren't sopping wet when you take them out of the washer. Plays a wonderful little tune when it's done. Who thought laundry could be fun?? It is now.\n",
      "Easy to use and make washing clothes fun. And the extra storage room is very helpful.\n",
      "I've been impressed with the dryer - easy to load, looks nice, runs quiet and energy efficient.\n",
      "This product is great! Never thought that such a awesome piece of technology would be so easy to use. Very intuitive user interface. Love the wifi function to connect with my Samsung Galaxy S5 through the Smart Home app. Worth the investment!!\n",
      "The cleaning action on this is unbelievable. Very low noise level. I will buy the bottom shelf as it is difficult to bend down to load and unload.\n",
      "Bought this front-load as part of a set. Using it for the second time today. I like the features on the control panel, very easy to understand and set up. The only draw-back is that the doors on both the washer and dryer sit very low to the ground and the drums on each are very deep I'm a tall guy and need to get down on one knee to get everything out from the back. I'm sure having the pedestals would help, but we could see spending another 500 dollars for a set of pedestals!\n",
      "These washer/dryers in stainless steel are beautiful machines. They work extremely well at cleaning clothes and drying them quickly. I love the steam feature to get out deep set stains and to get the clothes wrinkle free. Happy so far. However, I need a step stool to visualize the controls on the dryer as my machines are stacked and the controls for the dryer are slanted upward.\n",
      "I love my washer & dryer set it's like having a glass of wine and sitting back relaxing knowing that everything is ok ;) .....\n",
      "very nice looking and friendly. Does not have a microwave but has everything else. Wife loves it. Wish it would fit previously purchased pedestal.\n",
      "This is a great washer. At first we were skeptical about purchasing a steam washer. We love it!\n",
      "Love all the features it offers especially the steam cycle and it is very quiet compared to my old washer. Looking forward to replacing my dryer with a Samsung too.\n",
      "This machine is very quiet and gets clothes cleaner than my old front loader.\n",
      "So far this product has been excellent. The only issue we had so far was forgetting to take the shipping bolts out of the drum before doing a load of laundry! But once we figured out what was wrong we have had no issues so far! I love the steam function I use it a lot more then I thought I ever would.\n",
      "This is a new washing machine, and so far it is great.\n",
      "Bought this on 12/29/15 as of today 1/19/16 it has flooded my garage. Unbelievable! Waste of money and time!\n",
      "My first washer that is front load, I used these in the army and they always smelled funny.Gotta leave the door open so it can dry out! In colorado that isn't a problem.Have not had any issues with mine apart from after having it seemingly level and releveling again it keeps squeaking and moving during the last 5 mins of spin.\n",
      "It does not use much water ,it does not rinse well I use second rinse and one more extra rinse and there is still soap in the clothes .i have tried using less soap.I hate this washer.the new water saving washers are just like the water saving tolits you just flush more and new washers you use more water to rinse.\n",
      "Overall, we like this washer. We have owned it about one year now. Lowe's installation was ok, and the men did a fine job. The only problem we ran into was that there was a leak underneath the washer about 7 months into the install. The warranty covered the issue, but it does reduce our confidence somewhat that we won't have other short term problems down the road. Also, these units are heavy. Ensure you place a water drain pan underneath washer before installation.\n",
      "This is the first front load washer I have owned. It works Great!My husband was amazed at how quiet it is while running. He even shined a flashlight through the window to see if it was running.\n",
      "This washer is the best washer I have owned. It washes heavy duty loads with ease. My family of 6 goes through 3 - 4 loads each day and this washer is up to the challenge. I love how quickly each cycle runs through. I love the steam cleaning option for delicate items and bedding.\n",
      "heats fastno soundtimer very helpfulgood dryer\n",
      "I love this washer. It looks amazing in my laundry room! It was super fun to do laundry and wash it spin! Can't wait to keep using it!\n",
      "moved to a new home and purchased this washer ,so far i am very pleased with the product .It has a very good manual and it's easy to use ,love the childlock and self cleaning option.\n",
      "this machine is great washes clothes good whites whiter and color brighter iam so proud to have chosen this model\n",
      "so upset I bought this washer under the pre tense of a lows employee that it was a great machine. 8 months after owning it started to act up thank goodness I paid for the extended warranty as 2 days after the 1 year warranty it would not work it was getting stuck on 9 on the clock and washer smelled bad. so I decided to look up Samsung vtr stuck on 9 and it BROUGHT up hundreds and hundreds of complaints about the same problem and how Samsung just treated you BAD as they are doing to me now PLEASE PLEASE LOOKup Samsung before you buy its A BAD COMPANY for washers. im hopping Lowes does something as im a business owner and I spend a lot of money with them we will see if they reach out. AGAIN DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG\n",
      "I had fun watching it balancing the load during the rinse spin cycle. About as much fun as most of the TV programs that are on presently. Needless to say doesn't take much to entertain me. The washer was a much needed and appreciated gift from a son. Seems to get the job done superbly.\n",
      "this machine is cool! it is quiet and works well and saves me money on my utilities and with the Samsung name it should last a long time.\n",
      "We needed a washer dryer combo that was quiet enough to enable us to watch TV in the next room and this fit the bill nicely. I love all of the features and was quite surprised that we were getting them on a model that was this inexpensive. We have tried most of the different features and are very impressed. We have a stacked washer and dryer combination and are quite happy with them.\n",
      "I had a Samsung washer and it broke so instead of fixing it, I bought a new one. That should tell you what a good product it is to go right back to the same brand after you have one that breaks! I love the front loading washer as it is so easy for me to put clothes in and take them out. You have so many choices of short wash, steam, etc. I absolutely love the washer and would buy another as well. I also have the dryer. Great products.\n",
      "1. Washer door cannot be \"reversed\". I have to \"go around\" it when unloading clothes into my dryer2. There is an odor in the washing machine even though it is only two weeks old -- odor was there when it was delivered.3. When spin cycle is finished and clothes are ready to be removed, there is a water accumulation on the door glass.\n",
      "This washer is amazing! Incredibly easy to use. The quick wash only takes 26 minutes. It's very, very quiet. The audible alerts are a bit annoying, but I keep them on so I know the thing is working. It really makes no sound at all except at the very beginning and end of the cycle as the drain pump works.It does come with 2 rubber fill hoses, power cord and a drain hose. But I definitely recommend getting stainless steel braided fill hoses that are guaranteed not to burst.This is a VERY heavy item. The delivery cost (if applicable# is worth it!The only Con to this particular item is that the door is NOT reversible. It opens from right to left only. This renders the ability to reverse the door on the matching dryer #565990 electric or 565991 gas) completely useless.While not really a pro or a con, it does take some getting used to the time it takes to wash a load. The quick wash is 26 minutes; but a heavy soiled, steam wash, extra spin, extra rinse will take 3 hours and six minutes.\n",
      "wow what a great washer so many features and it spins clothes dry and clean couldn't ask for any better\n",
      "Very pleased so far. Quietly washed my queen size comforter and sheets with room to spare.\n",
      "The washer washes so quite. Its basically slient. Its amazing honestly!! I love how easy it is to use. Looks super high tech..but its easy to use. So cute how it plays a song when its done washing! Totally worth your money. You can wash big bulky loads too! I love it!!\n",
      "I have always preferred by Samsung innovation and durability, easy to install\n",
      "There are so many settings for all kinds of loads. I can wash without waking up whole house. Very well built.\n",
      "We just got our washer and we are very happy with the operation of this product and all of the great features.\n",
      "BEST WASHING MACHINE I HAVE EVER HAD. SUPER QUIET AND CLOTHES COME OUT SUPER SOFT\n",
      "I absolutely love this machine, if it is possible to love a washing machine. The instructions were so easy to follow and I feel like my clothes are cleaner than they have been in the past. I would recommend this machine to anyone looking for a new washer\n",
      "It's quiet and excellent. There's a feature that will turn of the button sounds, if you like sound, the machine plays a tune when the cycle is done. Pretty neat\n",
      "As of now, we don't have any issues with it and it works perfectly.\n",
      "I was looking affordable washer with Steam option this one fit the bill. Nice looking machine with brand value. I will reserve my Judgement on performance till six month usage.Just wish either in store or delivery guy know the product and give a demo as this one is loaded with features I think it will take time to go through each of them\n",
      "My husband bought me the Samsung front load washer and dryer and I cannot be any more satisfied. It looks super nice and is very simple to operate. My clothes smell so good and I'm using the same detergent that I always have. I would recommend the Samsung front load washer and dryer if you are in the market for a new one.\n",
      "Our Samsung washer is a replacement front load washer for another from another manufacturer that we purchased in 2004. The Samsung is MUCH quieter and has great features. It is pleasing aesthetically. Perhaps most important are the innovations intended to keep the smell from mold to a minimum, which ultimately was a \"selling point\" that resulted in us choosing this washer. We are limited by space in the laundry room and are now \"empty-nesters\" so we did not need (nor could we use) the larger capacity washers available from Samsung or other manufacturers. That having been said, this washer easily handles all our our laundry needs, and we are quite satisfied with our purchase!\n",
      "Great washer and really easy .to use! When you stack them with the dryer it takes up very little space.\n",
      "Love our new washer! Great Value and very roomy! Fits a lot of clothes, quiet and many features!\n",
      "Great washer, saves energy and water. A lot of functionalities.\n",
      "This is our second purchase of a Samsung washer We purchased one almost 4 years ago and purchased the extended warranty. Just shy of the expiration date, something went wrong with the drum. We were reimbursed for the washer in which we purchased a more updated Samsung. It works great, is quiet and cleans very well!! Highly recommend paying the extra money for the extended warranty .\n",
      "only had for a few days but so far I am happy with my purchase. Love the quick wash and seems to spin out very well where your clothes won't need to be dried as long, and lots of great features!\n",
      "Setup was easy, directions and use was easy to understand.\n",
      "This is our first front load washer and we were hesitant to purchase one. We were impressed that the washer is so quiet...we were not sure it was running. It is solid, quiet, works well. Bottom line - wife is happy so we are all happy :-)\n",
      "I am really enjoying my new washer. It has all the features that you may need to do your laundry properly and have them come out smelling clean and fresh.\n",
      "Quiet machine. Many cleaning options. Platinum color - it's a beautiful washer.\n",
      "I have his product and it is the best washing machine I have ever owned and I have been doing laundry for a long time.\n",
      "I TOTALLY LOVE IT I WENT AGAINST ALL REVIEW SAYING ANOTHER PRODUCT WAS BETTER BUT NOPE I STUCK WITH SAMSUNG AND ITS BEEN THE BEST CHOICE I EVER MADE. MY CLOTHES IS CLEAN AND JUST TH OVERALL LOOKS AND PERFORMANCE IS AMAZING.\n",
      "Great washer. Stained and soiled clothes come out clean every time! Awesome washing machine. Wish the drum had a light feature like the dryer does.\n",
      "We purchased this washer 5 months ago. I am so impressed with all of the features!!\n",
      "I first recommend reading the owners manual before using.\n",
      "This is a wonderful washing machine which handles any load with ease from delicates to workclothes to bedding.\n",
      "What I love most about this is how large the drum is. You can wash anything you need in this. The price I got for this was such a great deal and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.\n",
      "Did not expect this washer will be this good. My clothes are so clean using this machine. I love it!\n",
      "Many varied settings, great look, always wanted this\n",
      "nice and quiet, washes really good and spin cycles gets major part of water out of clothes to allow for less dry time. steam cycle get tough on stains out. great product for a very reasonable price\n",
      "This washing machine has many features that make it very convenient; such as telling you if you can add more pieces for the load selected. Water saver!\n",
      "Boring wash days are gone forever thanks to the captivating performances provided by Samsung's VRT ( Vibration Reduction Technology). With VRT all cycles even calibration mode leave you amazed and breathless. Because VRT is not achieved gently you are bothered as the machine begins to rock in its attempt to balance the load by performing various flips and turns of the drum. You become unsettled watching the machine move across the floor as it continues this balancing act at ever increasing speeds. And being both amazed and dumbfounded you are forced to witness this gyrating madness ramp up the rpm and thrust into the final spin leaving you breathless.Called Lowe's about a replacement - they didn't even question it and ordered me a new one...which leads me to believe - Houston I think we have a problem.\n",
      "The Samsung front load washer we purchased in 2010 recently failed in the drum being attached to the motor had broken. We purchased a new Samsung front load to match the dryer that we had purchased at the same time in 2010. Obviously some of the looks on the front had changed since 2010 so not a perfect match but we decided it was close enough to stay with the Samsung brand. We did discover we had to purchase another base for the washer since the 2010 version would not fit the new 2015 model. That was an extra expense to throw away a perfect base and the bases are not cheap. The big disappointment in the 2015 washer there is no internal light. Why Samsung would not include the light in the 2015 design we don't understand. It is difficult to see if you missed any clothes in the washer unless you stick your head inside the washer. We also have discovered the first day the detergent dispenser leaves some detergent in the dispenser at times. It seems to vary. One time it's empty the next time it still detergent in the dispenser after the wash cycle has run.\n",
      "All our household products we purchase are SAMSUNG.\n",
      "The look and features of this washer are wonderful. Speed, efficiency, color, design, and noise level are all great. The only thing that brought design down to 4 stars is the top metal plate. The plate/top on this model is thin metal and dents extremely easy. Yes, it dents even with some pressure from your finger. Found this out the hard way since we have to climb over it to hook it up, even used the edges (not the center).My parents have an extremely similar pair, just a slightly different model. They have thick metal plates on top. Found out these didn't the hard way.\n",
      "It is amazingly quiet and seems to clean well. My mom was happy.\n",
      "I've purchased a Samsung washer and dryer, and both have been wonderful. The washer has several cycle options that make doing laundry easy. The washer looks great and costs much less than other options in the store where I made my purchase. So far very pleased!\n",
      "This is a great value and a great machine. It is highly recommended.\n",
      "Love the front load washer. Wasn't sure at first but I love love love it.....\n",
      "WASHER MGREAT FOR BABY THINGS Y THINGS GREAT. I CAN SET MY OWN TYPE OF WASH CYCLE.\n",
      "It got some nice features, especially self clean which will clean the washer after use and there by avoid growing molds. Looks stunning and the dials are bigger, LED display is bright.\n",
      "We recently bought the Samsung washer and dryer and they are amazing!! It is incredible how clean and wonderful smelling the clothes are that we wash and dry. With a huge capacity on both we get our laundry done in half the time! I would reccommend these products to everyone!\n",
      "There is no review to accompany this rating.\n",
      "Only used the product a few times so far but have been impressed with how it performs and washes clothes. Still need to use the other options. Quiet machine though, love the display and the color.\n",
      "When my 14 yr old top loader died, I was reluctant to purchase a front load washer but I'm glad I did. It took a while to get used to the fact that there isn't much water in the drum, but my clothes do come out clean. I typically use the Normal cycle & select appropriate soil level, but the Bedding & Quick Wash cycles are good too. I've only used the Sanitize cycle a few times because it requires more time (that I don't usually have). Love the gray metallic color & the pedestals. MOST IMPORTANTLY -- when my washing is complete I ALWAYS leave the washer door open for at least 24 hours so it can dry out. I've never had an odor or mildew build up even though I live in a high humidity state. Have only needed to use the Self Clean Cycle a couple of times. Hope this helps!\n",
      "This is my second Samsung front load, the other was still working fine and was a bit smaller, so upgraded with this 4.2 @ Black Friday awesome price. This machine has great features, the Steam is great for whites, stains, tennis shoes and things that need deep cleaning. The option for added rinse, spin, pre soak are nice when needed. Front loaders do a very good job cleaning your clothes. I use HE detergent, and only a tablespoon for normal loads as I have soft water. Old top loaders used so much water and diluted the soap so I had to use more. This machine effectively tumbles the laundry thru a smaller amount of water and is gentler on the clothes. Spin cycle does well, and dryer keeps up with the washer on normal settings. As with any front loader, I leave the door open when not in use and have had no smell or mold with this or my last machine. If your setup doesn't allow for the door to be ajar, you may have a musty smell. I love the value, performance, and features of this washer. I hope it will last for 10 years, as nothing made today is made to last as machines were several years ago. My job is delivering appliances so I see all the names. There is occasionally a faulty unit, no matter who the manufacturer is. The extended warranty may be worth considering with ANY new appliance. This Samsung on sale was a great value for the size, and all the features it offers, and a solid performer.\n",
      "First I would easily recommend this washer. Its very quiet, easy to setup and easy to use. The quality is what I would expect for the price. Only issue I see is the door. When I purchased this I was told the door is reversible. It is for the dryer....but sadly apparently not for the washer door.\n",
      "I had this washing machine for a month and so far I haven't had any problems with it.Delivery was on time and after reading the manual it was ready to do laundry.I didn't get the pedestals and actually I think its best if the machine sits on the floor. It washes quietly and you don't even hear it running until it is spinning the clothes out. I don't know why some people complain that it is loud when spinning. Yes it does make noise when on the spin cycle but that is normal. Sometimes the machine does get off balance but the machine stops itself and automatically balances itself. This is normal for a front load machine because the clothes are tumbling unlike a front load washer where you place the clothes evenly and they stay that way.I tried every cycle on this washer and I think my favorite is bedding because it uses the most water. It does clean clothes real good even on normal which uses the least amount of water. The first load I did I had a shirt in the washer with oil stains from frying food and the washer took the stain out and I was impressed.Some people complain that there is water in the soap container, mine doesn't have water in the soap container. Maybe they didn't level the machine good? Also with the soap container the plastic inserts act as siphon cap, so if you don't leave the blue liquid fabric softer plastic piece in, the water will not drain.This is a good washing machine and I haven't had a single problem with it. Just remember to REMOVE THE SHIPPING BOLTS, Level the machine and RUN THE CALIBRATION MODE by pressing Temp and Delayed end at the same time then press the start button. Calibration mode is important because once the machine is leveled and isn't wobbling on any of the 4 corners, the calibration modes adapts the machines drum spinning and provides a more accurate weight level for water to be added to the machine.Now to save for the matching dryer. I am in love with laundry now, the machine performs beautifully and she is a beauty to look at too. Laundry is no longer a chore with this machine, it is a pleasure.also the seal drains real good, I do wipe it down to prevent mold and I also leave the door open a little bit so the machine can air out for a couple of hours after I used it.\n",
      "Took no time to install and once installed I quickly had more laundry to fold then I had shows I was waiting to watch. Very pleased.\n",
      "Happily surprised with the simple yet varied user interface and capabilities of this washer.We got the stand with it, so the height and the front load are great.Right away, we noticed that the clothes are much cleaner than they were with our old washer.\n",
      "This machine is quiet when running, does a great job on clothes, and is easy to select options and run. I'm overall very happy with this machine. To help others in their selection I want to note the following:1. The machine sits pretty low and the tub angles away from you, so you have to bend over and reach pretty far to empty out the items all the way back. This might be an issue for older people or those with limited mobility.2. Clothing in this tends to be more twisted than in my previous front load machine.3. Red color tends to show scuffs and scrapes a lot more readily than my old white one.4. My old machine was a 3.5 cf model and this is 4.2, but it seems to hold a LOT more clothing.I've had the washer for close to 6 months now, so have a good feel for how it works. Well worth the money I think, and I like that the door design does not collect water like the previous ones did with the accordian style.\n",
      "I bought this with the matching dryer and I am amazed with the performance and the LOOKS since then .I was bit nervous buying Samsung Laundry appliances but now happy with the performance ....Great product !\n",
      "I am loving my new appliances. Get the pedestal you will need them.\n",
      "We bought the washer & dryer just by chance. My husband loved the looks of the pair and the price was perfect. How could we go wrong. Well, I am one happy camper, love the machines and would recommend them to anyone wanting a new washer & dryer.\n",
      "Not long after we bought our washer, but just outside the warranty period, the latch on the door starting acting up. It cost over $300 to get it fixed. Just for a small little latch. Watch out for repairs.\n",
      "I like my machine so far (2 months). I like the various cycles, especially the sanitize cycle-even though it's 2 1/2 hours long. It has just started making a ticking noise at the final spin--not sure what that is. Clothes come out very clean.Dislikes: this is my first front loader and I am tall, so bending over and reaching in-especially way to the back of the machine is a pain. Sometimes the towels are plastered against the back wall of the drum and it's a long reach--sometimes have to get down on my knees. The pedestal would be a great idea, but that's extra $$, and the way my bathroom shelf is..it would be a tight fit. Overall, I like the results with my clothes, just the design could be easier for my situation.\n",
      "The clothes come out so clean! The steam feature can only help in our quest for the perfectlaundry adventure. The features are self explanatory with lots of bells and whistles. We justhad this delivered the past weekend and I'm very excited to explore it for all its worth!\n",
      "I previously had a Samsung that I loved, but sold it when I moved. So when I was looking for a new washer/dryer, Samsung was the only brand I would consider. This washer is quiet and does an excellent job in cleaning our clothes. I'm not sure I will use all the functions, but for the price, it has a nice selection. I color is pretty and looks nice in the laundry room. If you wipe the drum and seal after you finished washing you won't have any problems with it smelling musty. I also leave the door open overnight to make sure the inside dries. Theres a small amount of vibration if you have heavy items (like towels) during the spin cycle, which is normal.\n",
      "Wow, at first, I was not sure about a front load washer being a huge improvement over my old top load washer with agitator. But, this washer has simplified clothing washing so much, that I can't help talking about it to friends. It cleans great, from oily work clothes to blankets and uses minimal water too. If you are looking for a good washer, this is well worth the money.\n",
      "I have only had this washer for a week but we have already put it through its paces. The features are great for the purchase price. The steam option really does help get out stains, I put in a pair of jeans after doing a brake job on the car and it got everything out easily. However, this cycle did almost take two hours to complete. If you use the normal wash cycle, you should be fine in regards to wash cycle length. We also like the quick wash option which completes a small load in about 25 minutes. Sanitize and allergen cycle are great too; however, they take a super long time to complete (expect 2 hour times). The spin cycles are great and with the clothes coming out less damp, it's less time in the dryer. The amount of water per cycle has not been an issue for us like others have mentioned previously. Make sure to level and calibrate the machine before you use it. The calibration instructions are in the manual, not in the quick set up guide taped to the washer oddly.Time will tell if the machine holds up. We like the fact that there is a 10 year warranty on the direct drive motor but with these new washers having so many electrical components, there is a lot that can break. So far so good!\n",
      "We had this washer for about 3 weeks, so far it works good\n",
      "Love the usability, many features and cycle choices on this washer. It plays a great little tune at power on & at end of cycle. Easy to use & a real water and power saver. Child safety lock is a great feature.\n",
      "I love the purchase we made of our washer and dryer in February 2015 from our local Marquette, Mi Lowe's. We had such a great experience buying these that we went back a few hours later and purchased a new refrigerator. Monique was excellent in helping with our purchases.\n",
      "I absolutely love it If you need a dryer, this is the one. It's affordable and looks beautiful. Please do not hesitate or think twice. This is it!\n",
      "I've only had it a week, but I am very happy with the design, operation and efficiency of this product. It is far quieter than my previous front loader. The steam feature is nice, and produces great results on the allergen setting, however it does add a significant amount a time to the cycle. I am able to do a full load with just a small amount of HE laundry soap. This is the most efficient front loader I have owned so far. Only time will tell if it remains durable.\n",
      "With another kid on the way, we needed something that would last and I do believe that we found what we were looking for. Very nice looking, love the color. So much more quiet then our previous one.\n",
      "I absolutely love my washer, I still have yet to use all of its features but what i have used have been wonderful in a household with a toddler, two teens and animals. A definite word of advice is to leave the washer door open when not in use to prevent mold and mildew from forming.\n",
      "Had this machine delivered and a little over 2 weeks later it started a slow leak from the door. Lowes swapped it out for a new one and the very next day on my 3rd load, the same thing happened and also every time I start a new load I have to empty the water from the area where you put the detergent in. It was FULL of water. The first machine didn't do this - UGH!!! Now they are sending out a repairman to adjust the door!!! Which shouldn't leak in the first place, it is 1 day old! NOT HAPPY AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND SAMSUNG! Can't wait\n",
      "I've only had this washer for 5 weeks so I don't know for sure how I feel about it. So far it seems to be doing a good job and I haven't had a water bill yet to see if it is saving me water or not. I will update my review after I've had it longer.\n",
      "There is no review to accompany this rating.\n",
      "It could not finish whole cycle and door was locked just used two months. Call customer support and mechanic spent four weeks to fixed it. One year warranty definitely not enough. I will not recommend it to my friends.\n",
      "We have now had this washer for 3 months and I have to say I wish I had taken it back. It work well in the fact that its capacity is amazing we rarely ever fill it to capacity. The spin cycle is really amazing compared to most washers that we have had. Clothes are practically dry before moving to the dryer and this is where the issue is. I don't think this uses enough water to even wash my cloths. Almost every load I have to rerun my shirts as they rarely smell clean and usually still stink of body odor.We have tried all kinds of settings but it just doesn't use a lot of water.\n",
      "I love that this washer is 4.2 CF. It is still a large washer. love the features\n",
      "I am extremely satisfied with our purchase. We ordered this washer and dryer and both pedestals in the merlot color its absolutely stunning. The clothes come out SO CLEAN even on the quick wash cycle.We have Dogs and 2 Kids so we use the Sanitize mode a lot even though it takes 2 hours to wash the clothes come out stain free and i know that any bacteria is gone. Im so happy. We love you SAMSUNG XOXO\n",
      "I've had the front load washer/dryer for about 15 mos. now. I've already had to call/schedule repairs twice on the washer, which is unacceptable to me seeing as how it was brand new when I purchased it. Thank heavens I purchased the extended warranty! I will not be purchasing another Samsung washer. Not impressed. For something this fancy, and this expensive, I shouldn't have to deal with this. Staying home to wait half a day for a repairman, and not wanting to use the washer until the repairman looks at it. Inconvenient and worrying. It's new - what's going to happen when it actually starts to age?\n",
      "They really spruce up our laundry room, are quiet and do a great job.\n",
      "We really enjoy the new Samsung washer we bought at Lowe's. It works great and is built very well. I believe that it will last a long time and fit our needs quite well. Can't say enough about the quality of this product. Also, had a very good delivery process. Guys were professional, yet pleasant and really knew what they were doing. Product was delivered very quickly with no problems whatsoever.\n",
      "Washer was very easy to install. Wife and I had washer in house and connected. We was washing clothes in less than 30 minutes.\n",
      "I have had the washer for about 5 weeks. I like all the features on it. It is easy to use and very quiet. following all the instructions everything comes out great. I do recommend the pedestal especially if you are tall. I would recommend this washer\n",
      "I've only washed a few loads so far and I haven't had any issues, nor would I expect to this early. I am concerned about the extremely low water levels but apparently this is normal and the machine is operating as it should. Clothes come out clean and smell great!I was even more impressed with the online ordering process with Lowes. This particular washer and dryer set was out of stock at my local Lowes but the town over had them so I ordered them from there. Less than 24 hours later, I was washing clothes in my new machine that Lowes delivered, setup and even tested before they left. Super great service!!!\n",
      "I have only had my washer and dryer one day, but it runs very quietly and it is easy to operate. I am disappointed the washer door can not be reversed. Due to size of my laundry room it is very inconvenient, I am having to dryer door reversed. I may have to purchase the pedestals to make it easier to access the washer.\n",
      "This by far the worst investment I have ever made!! The door lock does not not work half the time I have hold it in. I have had it worked on 4 times and it works for awhile then it stops. Leaks from door sometimes because of it. Total junk and I cannot believe how much I spent for a piece of junk!!\n",
      "When my previous washer died I decided to try Samsung. I am very happy with the way it cleans the clothes I didn't realize what a poor job my old washer was doing. I like the front loader and I did not put it on anything it is the same height as my dryer. I love that it plays music when it is done, no more running to check if the loads done. You do have to leave the door open for awhile, I never close it all the way when its not in use. I find it takes less time to dry my clothes now. I am so happy with my washer that when my dryer goes I will get the Samsung dryer to match.\n",
      "We bought this washing machine 4 years ago and after that time the bearings and drums need replacing due to balance issues. We won't be buying another Samsung as the technician said this is a common problem with this brand.\n",
      "I bought a Samsung 5 years ago. Tub cracked. The tech said it happens often with Samsung washers. I called Samsung to see if they would help me in anyway (about a $600 repair) and they said no way! They were even rude to me!!! No thanks! Consumer Report has it wrong on this one.\n",
      "Prior to last week I would have given this product 5 stars, but it just quit working. No 7 month old appliance should quit in this time-frame. Fortunately, it is still under manufacturer and extended warranty.\n",
      "I realy had a mindset that I did not want an HE machine - my old one works just fine - thank you! But, when my washer bit the dust after 15 years - I bought one because I liked the color!! Ok, not a good reason, but I really liked the merlot finish. But, this machine does a great job on cleaning the babies clothes - with a toddler and a creeper we have lots of dirt, food and things we don't even know where they came from on thier dresses and outfits. This machine cleans them and they are brighter than they were after going thru the old washer. The only thing I don't really like is the time it takes to run a load which is about an hour for a standard load.\n",
      "Overall, functions very well. Opening of tray for wash detergent could be a little bigger though. Light in the wash drum needs to be brighter.\n",
      "Bought this in 2011. I do less than 8 loads a month. Is broken beyond repair. Had electrical panel problem. Samsung charged $400 to \"fix\" it. Still not working. Now they tell me it'll cost $700 for parts for new ball bearings to make it spin! Not worth the money.\n",
      "Took a chance and purchased this washer and dryer last year after I heard alot of complaints about front loaders. I have to say I love everything about this set! My clothes have never been cleaner. My towels which normally came out wrinkly look like they are fluffy and new after being washed and dried! Its a beautiful color and look for my new home. There is a self cleaning mode on my washer. I leave my washer cracked slightly as I have heard about mold build up which has never happened. Would definitely purchase again! The only con I can find is unlike the top load washers, there is not a way to soak clothes unless you have a utility sink. Definitely take a chance and buy this set! You won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Please go on the internet and review Samsung washers! We got a 350 model--well we inherited it from a house we recently bought--it's only 2 years old and it's a real piece pretty piece of junk. High end, more expensive model keeps going off balance, rebalancing does no good, does NOT get the clothes clean and sinks constantly. Yes, I've tried Allfresh, Tide washer cleaner and bleach--each 2 times since we've been stuck with this model. The smell keeps returning. This machine is a money pit. If you research Samsung's so called higher end, higher quality, higher efficiency washers you will learn a lot! We are going to replace this washer with something simpler, as the settings are way too complex and so many things to go wrong! You will also learn that Samsung has had many, many complaints to various consumer advocate agencies about their hype versus reality. I also owned one of their huge refrigerators. The ice always collected frost and stuck together in the ice maker because their engineers didn't have the smarts to have a small gadget close the actual ice maker (not the door opening), so every time you open the refrigerator door, air goes right up that ice maker shoot and good luck breaking it apart because it works the motor like mad trying to break up the mess. Just do your research before buying anything Samsung!\n",
      "Its quiet, efficient, saves energy and washed items come out virtually dry. I love all the features and all the setting options it gives you. I'm very happy with this washer!\n",
      "My washer quit on a Sunday evening so off to Lowe's we went. Samsung items were on sale and I had always wanted a front loading machine. We purchased the pair and brought the washer home since I needed to ready items for a trip. My husband installed the washer and wallah.........I was in business. I love it and was amazed how the whites were whiter. Love the fact that you can use liquid or powder soap. Learning new things about it every day.\n",
      "We looked at a variety of stores and decided on Lowe's. We had a very nice and knowledgeable associate. He took his time to explain the product to us. I was thrilled with the delivery people. Would have much rathered had a lowe's associate.\n",
      "There is no review to accompany this rating.\n",
      "I am very pleased with the dilervy drivers . Very well manners an explain things to me. Thanks again\n",
      "The Samsung washer/dryer combo we bought is one of the best purchases ever. Bought it on sale so it was cheaper than buying a \"stacked\" combo that we replaced. We live in a condo so space is and noise was a consideration. The washer is amazing quiet compared to our old one, washes pretty big loads (>15 towels) and after the spin cycle most things are almost dry. Great value as Lowe's delivered them and set them up for free!!\n",
      "I have had this washer for over 2 months and have not had an issue. I am careful to wipe it down after each load and leave the door and the detergent tray open when not in use. My clothes have come out clean and fresh and my drying time has decrease significantly over my last washer.\n",
      "We purchased this unit about 11 months ago and it seems to work fine. The only nagging issue I have at this time is that the fabric softener compartment empties the softener into the drum with the laundry, but is left filled with water at the end of the wash cycle. This is very frustrating to resolve. I've been sent a replacement part which didn't help. A technician has been dispatched & replaced all of the compartments to no avail. I wish I had picked another front load washer. It looks great and has many features, but this little problem is like having one fly trapped inside your house that keeps buzzing around and you can't get rid of it.\n",
      "This is a replacement for the Whirlpool Front Load Washer we had. We started getting \"SUD\" and an error all the time, then our washer died. My wife and I did quite a bit of research and looked at opinions. We were drawn between the LG and Samsung. After talking to a friend at work, he's had the Samsung for a few years, and he's had no trouble. We bought it, assembled it ourselves, stood it up and we've been doing laundry ever since last week. We bought the 5 year extended warranty as well. It's been working great.\n",
      "My old washer was one of those top loader no agitator types. Knew as soon as I did a load of white clothes that it was awful. The sheets always came out twisted into knots.My new front loader is so easy to use and the whites came clean on the first wash.I did a load of sheets (king size) and they came out wonderful. (not twisted into knots)I have used every feature so far except the sanitize cycle, haven't needed it yet.I really like how much water is removed in the spin cycle.My old dryer doesn't have to work so hard.\n",
      "We purchased online and picked up in the store... was scheduled to deliver from store but fell on a holiday weekend so we decided to get them earlier. Lowe's was fast pulling the item and helping put them in the truck.My husband and I installed them and it's very difficult doing this with 2 people, and I am a pretty strong woman! You will need 3-4 people to help unwrap and lift them out of the styrofoam they are in.Other than that the install was easy!Only Con is that the hoses that come with it are pretty cheap (the cold water one leaked). Luckily we had pretty expensive ones on the old machine and just used those!PLEASE READ INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USING WASHER!!! We didn't and didn't know there are \"shipping bolts\" in the back (3 to be exact), and it made the spin cycle move and bounce the whole washer sideways... and that thing is NOT light. So luckily we did no damage because we turned it off right away and found the problem.Color is beautiful like red wine, and they are super quiet... I recommend!!\n",
      "great looking. Excellent features. Love the quietness. The doors are kinda awkward because it opens towards the dryer and the dryer opens toward the washer. Makes putting the clothes into the dryer a little difficult. We're going to try and switch them around. Other than that great set\n",
      "When I purchased My Washer & Dryer, Lowe's told me they always had service readily available. When the washer broke, Lowes gave my an \"800\" number to call. The Service Center does not have anyone within 100 Miles. I guess I will go back to Sears for appliances.\n",
      "Overall this is a nice washer machine with great features and smooth running. Unfortunately it is also poorly built. On the third year the spinning cycle started getting louder and louder and the whole thing would shake violently. Had a Sear tech coming to check it and dropped the bomb. The main chamber bearing is worn off and needs to be changed. I am talking about standard use, a 3 adult household using the machine 2 times a week in average.Just getting a new bearing will cost $750, bought directly form Samsung, labor will bring the total to $930. So, now we are just waiting for the washer to die and preparing to get a new one. My first and last Samsung appliance, in fact my last Samsung anything.\n",
      "Love the washer, it does a great job. I just wish the door opened the other way. We have an older home and cannot set the washer and dryer side by side, so it's awkward to empty the washer to the dryer, but I still love it\n",
      "Lowes in Quincy, IL delivery center was awesome.. Thanks Guys!!!!!\n",
      "Will be returning this machine and getting a washer with an agitator !!!!!! Worst purchase I have ever made !! Will not remove dirt ,grease,or oil ! Even set on heavy duty with all the extra functions wich is a 2 hour wash cycle that can take up to 3.5 hours !!!! Half of wich is setting there doing nothing while it try's to figure out how to balance itself . What a waste.\n",
      "After days of reading reviews from four different stores on top loaders & not being able to settle on one that had decent reviews, we ended up at our local Lowes who was finally able to fit us with a fantastic machine that would clean our family of four's clothes with ease. One of which, is a logger & comes home full of saw dust & mud on a daily basis. This washer does tend to become off balance for a few seconds causing it to become a little loud during it's spin out, but quickly comes back in balance & does a fantastic job! I never even wanted to look at front loaders due to so many negative reviews, but because of my husband's work, this is what was recommend to us. I absolutely love it!!! I plan to regularly clean it like recommended, I wipe down seals after every use, & keep the door open so air can pass through. I have also noticed you may have to remove the soap tray to wipe it out also.\n",
      "We are on our 2nd washer and it is also out of round. We have had this one for 2 months. The technician basically said it would need to be completely torn apart and put back together. Totally unacceptable for a new Washer. We spent $14,000 on filling two houses with Samsung products and we are also getting ready to get a different refrigerator too because it still doesn't work after three service calls. Samsung has been a real let down in our new home. We are now trying to rid the entire house of the product as nothing is working right.\n",
      "Well, this is the first front load clothes washer I have purchased. I got it home, unloaded and connected, and my wife started a small load. WOW! we both stood there and watched it run a complete cycle. This machine will definitely lower the water bill and with the more efficient, quieter than a whisper direct drive motor, electric energy as well. Unless you have very soiled clothes from working in the yard, etc., the short cycle (26 Min) cleans quite well. The machine also has a self cleaning cycle to clean and sanitize the shiny stainless steel drum periodically. I do not think you can go wrong with this unit. It is practical and entertaining.\n",
      "There is no review to accompany this rating.\n",
      "We were trying to match our dryer we had purchased previously for a rental. We needed something of value and durability to withstand the extra use. It looks great and runs quietly. No more problems with leaks or anything else. Good product!\n",
      "Love the color of this washer. Its quiet & does a good job getting your clothes clean. I also love that it does not \"walk\" like my Kenmore did. My Kenmore also was getting unbalanced alot. I have not had that problem once so far with this washer. My Kenmore was 8 yr old but it had to be bolted to the floor to fix the \"walking problem & the unbalanced problem was not fixable unless you put in more items & started all over. The one thing I cannot believe anybody has mentioned is the self cleaning cycle that TAKES 4 HRS AND ONE MINUTE TO COMPLETE!!!!!! Did they say this washer was energy efficient? Talked with the company a couple of times but they say this is right. So I guess it takes half a day to swish water around in your machine to get it clean. Sorry can't believe that's energy efficient.\n",
      "This review is for the WF42H5200AF 4.2-cu ft High-Efficiency Front-Load Washer with Steam Cycle (Merlot). To begin with, I want to explain to potential buyers of this machine about the negative reviews. When I first set up the washer, I thought I had everything leveled just right. The problem was, I set the level in the center on top of the machine from front to back and in the center from left to right. (It showed a true level) I did the test cycle and I thought the machine was going to go flying apart. I then leveled the machine by putting the level on all four sides, on top of course which was rear, left to right, front, left to right, and both sides front to back. After everything was leveled in this manner, I washed my first load, only taking up half of the washing machines capacity.Sure, there is only a few thumps now for the first few seconds of a rinse or spin cycle. This is normal. I have 3 friends who own frontloads. A Samsung like mine (Which why I bought mine, and I did not ask my friend about how he set his up, whish I did), a Whirlpool and an LG. They all make this little thump when going to spin or rinse.As far as the detergent tray, people are saying that they are experiencing excessive water trapped in there. Well, after my wash is done, I barely have a tablespoon of water thats left behind, regardless if i use Tide Pods directly in the machine or Tide Liquid in the tray. I am thinking those who are complaining about that, their machines are leaning down hill so to speak.Another issue I see is people wondering/complaining why they do not see much water in the machine while washing. For one, the water is in between the stainless tub and a plastic outer tub. If you look closely at the agitators, there are small holes that releases the water while in the wash/rinse mode.Now for the quality. The quality is great, except for the control panel. It is plastic of course. The red color does not match the rest of the machine, but it is close. This control panel scratches fairly easy. I have had no issues of broken or flimsy doors (Or leaks yet, I hope not) but I did buy the 5 year extended warranty.Finally, what I do like about this washer. It is quiet while washing. I can smell the cleanliness when the clothes are done. The clothes spin dry very well. This machine has cut my dryer time in half. I love the touch button controls.As with all frontload machines, remember to keep the door ajar after your final wash. This will keep your machine from forming mildew.\n",
      "Stay away from this model washer, but the dryer is good.\n",
      "Not my first choice but Associate worked with me and decided on this model. Within 24 hours of old machine failing I had new washer installed and working. Using several cycle choices and very satisfied.\n",
      "From day one this washer did not work properly. I installed per the instructions and balanced it. From the very first run it made an obnoxious \"banging\" noise when spinning up. It banged so bad that the drum would push the door out. Once it reached full speed it ran smooth. I thought the load was unbalanced, then I ran it empty. Even empty it still banged like crazy at medium RPMs. That when I called Samsung....big mistake.Good news, the repairman was excellent. The bad new, Samsung claimed that the banging was perfectly normal even after the repairman said it clearly shouldn't do that, especially when empty. I decided to return this machine. I've read a lot of bad reviews and a lot of great reviews about Samsung. I won't buy a Samsung washer again. Not worth it. It was a huge hassle to make a warranty claim and then return this machine. Lowes did a good job and exchanged with no problems.\n",
      "Owned for less than a week but so far I'm impressed. Went through 2 LG front loaders in the last 5 years so there is no way I was forking over the cash for another.This machine is much quieter with less vibration during the spin cycle than my previous washers so the VRT seems to be adding some level of balance to the load.Samsung washers appear to be ranked #1 for customers choice according to JD Power so this machine is a good buy especially if you catch it on sale.\n",
      "This washer beats our old Whirlpool Duet by a long shot. Purchased Duet in 2006:new bearings in 2010, 2012, 2014, new MCU ($308), clothes & washer stank after use.The price was a deal, clothes are fresher smelling, spins well enough that dryer is not taking as long, & the features ease of use is great.I would recommend this washer to anyone.\n",
      "There is no review to accompany this rating.\n",
      "Purchased washer a week ago and so far so good. Seems to remove stains and spins dry clothes better than previous washer. Pedestal should be included since front loading /unloading access is too low for me.\n",
      "I bought this washer just one week ago and have already used every cycle it has. I can't believe this washer - best washer I've ever owned. It is quiet, efficient, and as far as quality goes, it has my previous washer beat in every department. I had a Whirlpool and it went out 3 times in just over 4 years. So we went with this Samsung because of Consumer's Reports reviews and we aren't one bit sorry. Recommend this washer to anyone looking for quality and not a huge price tag. For those who say their washer is noisy and walking across the room - be sure all four corners are leveled with the floor and it does work best on a LEVEL floor such as concrete or tile. And be sure to read your operating instructions thoroughly because a front loader is much different from a top loader.\n",
      "This washer is very efficient and my clothes come out clean every time. I'm still getting used to the HE washer and how little water it uses and the fact that it takes longer to wash a load. The trade off is that it gets so much water out in the spin cycle that dryer time is cut way back. It is a little difficult to get items out of the washer at the back. Mine is not on a pedestal so I have to bend down and stretch to the back to get everything out. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning.\n",
      "Good product and sufficient to do most loads. Doesn't really work well with heavier loads.\n",
      "The techs leveled the washer so well that you can hardly tell its washing.The only issues as of today is the door is a little flimsy when opening and closingAnd the detergent draw leaks a little and it is also flimsy. But again we have had and usedFor three weeks and no major problems besides the very tiny leaking draw.\n",
      "The washer works pretty well for washing clothes and I have no complaints besides the control panel. The lettering for all the controls and settings on the control panel are not affixed, or printed on the panel well. My experience was one day I walked up to the washer and a couple of settings were smeared real bad. I tried wiping them lightly with a soft dry cloth and they just wiped off. I then dabbed them with water and it removed the smeared part but other parts were still there. Then a couple of months later same thing. Samsung will not fix it, they claim it is cosmetic and it is not covered. When the lettering wipes off the control panel and you cannot read the settings I think it is more than cosmetic. I have seen where this is not an isolated issue with Samsung Washers, by researching the internet. By the way we only use HE detergent and do not use fabric softeners or any other products. If laundry detergent causes the lettering to come off then it is not a very good washer. Customer Service through Samsung was terrible.\n",
      "No problems so far. It is real easy if you read the owners manual first. Hoses DO come with the machine. Sales man tried to sell me a set but the old ones were still good. I was just going to replace the washers but there was a new set of hoses in the washer. I got a Military discount on top of the sale price = Great Deal. Set up was a breeze did it all myself. No problem balancing. Settings are many. We ended up with the Heavy Duty, Eco warm, fast spin and heavy soil. Programed it in to memory, \"My Setting\". Clean fresh smelling almost dry clothes every time.\n",
      "Love my new washer! And the little ditty for the end of cycle is cool!\n",

      "We just purchased the washer and dryer and so far so good. They are both very easy to use and very quite. We did not need the stands and they are still very accessible. This is our first front loader machine, but we did our research and this one was worth the value. All we have is Samsung products and they have not dissapointed us yet. Our laundry room is right next to our bedroom and both machines are very quite.\n",
      "The only problem I, have is when they installed the washer! They scratched the door facing\n",
      "I love the ease of loading and turning on the cycle. With the press of a couple of buttons the technology takes over. The washer even plays a little tune when finished. I am loving the Samsung washer! Hope it lasts a long time!\n",
      "The controls are easy to use and the extra features are very nice. It is a little wobbly in the spin cycle even with perfect leveling. It doesn't seem to balance the load as well as a conventional washer. Overall, very happy with the product.\n",
      "I was doing two loads of wash at least three times a week, now it's accomplished in two loaders once a week! Water does tend to stay in the soap/softener dispenser but just removing and wiping it out is no problem. Quiet, clothes cleaner than ever. Haven't used steam function yet. Great product!!!\n",
      "my wife loved it when i bought her maytag topload HE set and it was very bad left the clothes shribbled n just like twisted, so i returned them for samsung front load HE and the difference is incredible best set ever clothes come out rinkle free ...\n",
      "I had a Whirlpool Duet for 10 years & when it was dying I did a lot of research on high efficency washers. I seriously debated between the Sumsung and a LG both with the steam cycle.The capacity of this washer is greater than my old machine and much quieter. The other aspect that I really appreciate is that the machine seems to do better with larger loads and is does not do the loud sounds that my Whirlpool used to make. The 10 year warranty was a nice surprise, although the reviews on the warranty are rather sketchy.The added bonus for me was the color of the machine and the sale price was what finally sold me on the Samsung. I'm so pleased with this purchase!!My only negative comment was getting the machine from Lowes to my home, as delivery to my area was not an option. (Common Lowes, you delivered to me in the past.) As a single person who does not have a vehicle large enough to transport this was disappointing. I offered to pay more for delivery and ended up renting a truck to get it home.\n",
      "Gets the clothes super clean. Its so quiet most the time I don't even know its running. I finally have a washer big enough to wash my extra thick king comforter. no complaints\n",
      "Have only had for a few weeks. No problems so far. Great black friday pricing. Much better than our old agitator. Easy to use, clean look, fairly quiet compared to our old machine.\n",
      "I don't know if I'd have paid full price for the dryer/washer I bought but at Lowes they always have appliances on sale and this purchase was indeed a deal! Love love love my new set and the color, I can't say enough!\n",
      "This is my first front loader washing machine. I had a nice quality top loader brand new and matching dryer for the past 10 years when suddenly the washer quit. I was forced to purchase a new washer and was not intending on buying one at this time. We decided to go with the front loader for several reasons including efficiency and economically.First off, installation was easy as pie. Simple hookup as the same as the old top loader.I didn't understand what people meant by saying it cleans your laundry better until I was folding my fresh laundry after being washed with my new Samsung front loader. I actually smell the fabric softener. The clothes feel so soft and I can actually see and feel the difference in my clothes! They are cleaner and I can smell the difference. The clothes are so soft. I did not purchase the dryer at this time because our dryer works fine so we will wait. I was so impressed because since we had the brand new set 10 years ago, the dryer would sense the clothes were not dry at the end of the dry cycle and go on extended time EVERY load. Now that I have this new efficient front loader that extracts more water, my dryer is working FASTER! I am so happy! I will probably get the matching dryer soon to see if that can amaze me also!The only reason I did not give 5 stars for design, I wish the door had the option to open to the right.\n",

      "We have had our machine for only a week but I can already tell that it is a cut above the Kenmore appliances we replaced after only 5 1/2 years. Runs quietly, cleans with less detergent and water and is so easy to operate.\n",
      "I love this washer. The only thing I don't like is the smell, but it is fading. I love the chirping noise it makes. I love all the various settings. This washer has a huge capacity. I would buy this one again!! It washes very well and clothes come out smelling great. I would not pay full price for it, but I got it on a great sale and it was well worth it.\n",
      "This Samsung washer is a large beast, and even larger mounted on a pedestal. Lowe's delivered and installed the machine which ran well during the install test. However, the machine rocked and rolled unacceptably during the first load: a California king fleece blanket. Because it was the only piece in the machine, the drum action caused the blanket to wind over on itself, so at the end of the cycle, the center of the wound up blanket didn't seem to have been washed.A second load, with more pieces, produced a better wash, although the machine vibration persisted. A few days later a Lowe's technician adjusted the machine, tightening it to the pedestal. He said that the pedestal mount is not as stable as having the machine sit directly on the floor, so some vibration was inevitable. Also the machine was built to handle heavy loads, and a small load would cause some unbalance and result in some vibration. My next fuller load was better.So here's the skinny: level all sides of the machine, tighten it securely to its pedestal if you purchased one, and wash large loads. We're keeping ours.\n",
      "I bought my first Samsung front load washer and matching dryer from Lowe's on 8-1-12 installed.The washer is now banging or knocking (I think it's a drum bearing going out). The dryer has a knocking soundbut can't see anything wrong with it. I'm now spinning an extra 15 min. to get the water out as it won't spin out the water the first time around.Machines still look brand new. I leave a rag in the door of the washer to stop any odors from starting up and have never had a problem with that.I added pedestals and they are worth every cent.\n",
      "Our 15-year old Kenmore washer finally broke down 2 weeks ago. In 15 years, this is the only time that the washer has had any issues. I considered ordering parts and repairing the old beast, but was convinced to get a new one. Now that I've made the purchase and the old one has been taken away, I'm left questioning the judgement of those who suggested I replace the old machine. After completing this purchase last Saturday, they were able to deliver it on Monday and now on Friday, the brand new unit isn't working and it seems to be a problem with the drive unit. We did manage to get 2 loads of laundry done since it was delivered, so now instead of being two full weeks behind on laundry, we are only like 13 days behind. On top of that, they can't have a technician look at it until next Thursday, so I have to wait another week to use the set we just spent close to $2300 on, or head to a laundromat. These may very well be the last Samsung products I ever purchase.\n",
      "Very happy with this purchase. Quiet operation. Easy to use controls. Love the clean cycle; no more buying washing machine cleaner and no more smelly washing machine. Love that it reminds you every 40 loads so you don't have to remember to run the clean cycle.\n",

      "Beautiful color. Runs so so quiet. Nice ring tones as alerts on machine. Has Steam feature that connects with dryer. The price is very competitive now as apposed to years ago for this machine. Comes with a 10 year manufacture warranty on the drive belt which says to me that the manufacturer has confidence in their appliance. Also purchased the matching dryer and is super quiet as well. Both drums hold a ton of clothing, towels, etc.\n",
      "Have had issues with this washer from the beginning with the spin cycle. It takes 3+ hours to wash a load of laundry. Even empty it has trouble balancing the drum. Do not waste your money!\n",
      "I've never used anything but a bog-standard washer before, so the array of settings and the way you can combine them selectively is great. I haven't tried out all of them yet, but I especially like the \"no spin\" option for semi-delicate stuff you just want to wash, drain and hang out on the line. Cleans well; quickly when you need it for light-to-regular loads; deeply when you're washing grubby work clothes or something the cat has barfed on. Mainly though, the \"Merlot\" set we bought is a really pretty shade of red - if you're going by the online photos alone, this Samsung set is a bit darker than the comparable LG set Lowe's offers, which is more of a bright fire engine red. Red appliances won't work in every setting, but this one does for us, and there's no need to hide it in a cupboard, which was brilliant as we didn't have the space to do that in our tiny laundry room. Have had lots of compliments on the color.Word to the wise - read the instructions before cleaning the filter (yes, there is a filter on it, recommended for cleaning every two months). Some water will drain out when you do this, so make sure you have something in which to catch it. Also, like most front-loaders it benefits from an airing-out after a wash to avoid mustiness; I speed this up by wiping down the door and drum with a clean cloth first.\n",
      "I had a Samsung that was about five years old that I liked so I stayed with the brand. Does a great job with the laundry with minimal wear and tear on the items washed. Spins out very, very dry. There are a great many choices about cycle and treatment. I like that it has a spin only setting which my previous washer did not have.Not fond of the faux chrome look. Would prefer something more utilitarian looking in my laundry room but understand this is not the trend.\n",

      "I purchased a new style LG because it liiked really impressive, after two replacements, we went back to what we knew. This is their new style Samsung and it is the best washer and dryer that I have ever had. My wife loves this washer, and it is fast and efficient. It outperforms the other Samsung unit that we had, which suprised me, because it worked really well. I assure you you will be ultimately impressed with this unit along with its steam dryer partner.\n",
      "They had all items purchased in stock, so delivery was fast. This is my first front loader, but I have LG/Samsung flat screens and really like the quality of the brand. Washer is a little noisy at times until the load balances out. The dryer is great and both units have a lot of feature and is easy to use. The washer has a filter that will need to be replaced periodically (I didn't know that at time of purchase. But after a week of use I'm very happy and they fit perfectly in the laundry room.The guys that delivered and set it up were very nice and professional.\n",
      "This is the best washer I've ever had the pleasure of using. Lots of setting choices, it's quite, it's quick, and you can even have it play a song when it's done! The kids even find it easy to use.\n",
      "I have saved 50% in water usage! as well as Landry detergent and softener. Our electric bill has also gone down, one of the best purchases we have ever made. Oh! By the way our clothes are cleaner now!\n"
